# A.C.E. 6th Grade Skill Intensives Sequence (2025 Cycle)

## Introduction

This document outlines the recommended sequence of **monthly A.C.E. Skill Intensives** (practical, execution-based courses) for participants in the standard **6th Grade A.C.E. Homeschool Program** during the 2025 Cycle. These intensive courses are taken **one per month**, concurrently with the **Daily Core Curriculum** studies (Language Arts, Math, Science, History, etc.).

Each Skill Intensive focuses on developing specific practical competencies through hands-on execution, culminating in a tangible **deliverable** that becomes part of the participant's **Portfolio of Execution**. This sequence aims to build foundational skills, instill A.C.E. work habits (discipline, accountability, quality), and provide broad exposure relevant to multiple A.C.E. Pathways, preparing students for more specialized Tracks starting in 7th or 8th grade.

*(Note: Slight variations may occur based on resource availability or specific cohort needs. GT students follow a separate, potentially accelerated sequence found in the GT Track directory.)*

*   **Month 6: `ACE-SR-101`: Ecosystem Observation & Documentation**
    *   *Focus:* Developing keen observational skills of the natural environment (weather patterns, plant growth stages, water flow, animal signs), systematic recording techniques (nature journaling with text/sketches/photos), basic data collection for environmental factors (e.g., rainfall measurement, temperature logs). Safety during outdoor observation.
    *   *Deliverable Example:* A detailed nature observation journal covering a specific local site over several weeks, including structured observations, sketches/photos, and basic data logs.
    *   *(Link: `../../Tracks/Foundational_Skills/ACE-SR-101_Ecosystem_Observation/README.md` - Placeholder Path)*

*   **Month 7: `ACE-MEDIA-101`: Introduction to Visual Composition & Story**
    *   *Focus:* Applying fundamental visual design principles (from `DES-DSGN-101` if taken, or introduced here) specifically to photography and visual narrative. Understanding shot composition rules using readily available cameras (smartphones encouraged). Basic sequencing of images to tell a simple story.
    *   *Deliverable Example:* A curated set of photographs demonstrating specific compositional techniques (rule of thirds, leading lines, etc.); a simple photo essay telling a story in 5-10 images.

## Important Notes

*   **Prerequisites:** Each listed Skill Intensive assumes successful completion of A.C.E. Phase 0 and generally follows the sequence shown. Specific prerequisites will be detailed in each Course README.
*   **Links:** Links currently point to a conceptual `Foundational_Skills` track folder; actual course locations may reside under different specific Tracks as the catalog is fully built out.
*   **Execution:** Successful completion of each monthly Skill Intensive, demonstrated through its Execution Gate deliverable, is required for progression.

This sequence provides a broad and robust foundation across multiple domains, preparing 6th-grade participants for more specialized learning in subsequent A.C.E. years while reinforcing core academic studies and ARKTIK values through practical execution.
