# A.C.E. 7th Grade: Core Curriculum - History (Texas Focus)

## Role & Purpose

Welcome to 7th Grade History within the ARKTIK Curriculum for Education (A.C.E.). As a core academic subject engaged with **daily**, History provides the essential context for understanding the present by examining the past. This course focuses primarily on **Texas History**, from its early inhabitants and geography through major events like the Revolution, Republic, statehood, Civil War, and Reconstruction, exploring the diverse peoples, pivotal moments, and foundational principles that shaped the state.

In A.C.E., History emphasizes **critical thinking**, the **analysis of evidence** ("Truth over Feeling"), understanding **cause and effect**, recognizing diverse **perspectives**, and connecting historical events to enduring themes of governance, community, resilience, and stewardship – principles vital to ARKTIK's mission. This curriculum is designed with the goal of aligning with or exceeding established educational standards, such as the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS), for 7th grade Texas History.

*(Note: Gifted & Talented (GT) students may follow an enriched curriculum, potentially integrating more deeply with global concepts from the HIST-iSTEAM 101 track. See the GT Track documentation for details.)*
