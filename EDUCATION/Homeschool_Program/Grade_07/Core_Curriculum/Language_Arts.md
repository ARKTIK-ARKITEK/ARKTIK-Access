# A.C.E. 7th Grade: Core Curriculum - Language Arts

## Role & Purpose

Welcome to 7th Grade Language Arts within the ARKTIK Curriculum for Education (A.C.E.). This core academic subject, engaged with daily, provides the essential foundation for effective communication, critical thinking, and understanding the power of narrative and information in all its forms. Strong language arts skills are fundamental not only for academic success and potential college readiness but also for impactful execution in nearly every A.C.E. Pathway and Track.

In A.C.E., Language Arts emphasizes **clarity, precision, integrity, and purpose** in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. We focus on building mastery of language mechanics not just as rules, but as tools for constructing meaning, conveying truth, engaging audiences ethically, and contributing effectively to the ARKTIK community and beyond. This curriculum is designed with the goal of aligning with or exceeding established educational standards, such as the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS), for 7th grade.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of 7th Grade Language Arts, participants will demonstrate the ability to:

*   Read and comprehend increasingly complex literary texts (fiction, drama, poetry) and informational texts (non-fiction, articles, technical documentation basics), identifying main ideas, supporting evidence, author's purpose/perspective, and rhetorical strategies.
*   Analyze literary elements including theme, character development, plot structure (connecting to LA-PW 101 concepts), conflict, setting, and figurative language (metaphor, simile, personification, symbolism).
*   Master the writing process (planning, drafting, substantial revising for clarity/organization, precise editing for grammar/mechanics, publishing/sharing appropriately) across various modes.
*   Write clear, coherent multi-paragraph compositions including well-developed narratives (personal/fictional), informative expository essays (explaining/comparing), and basic structured argumentative pieces with relevant evidence.
*   Apply grammatical conventions correctly and consistently, including sentence structures (simple, compound, complex, compound-complex), punctuation (commas, semicolons, colons, apostrophes), capitalization, and spelling.
*   Expand academic and domain-specific vocabulary through reading, context clues, and understanding of roots and affixes.
*   Conduct basic research by formulating questions, locating and evaluating the credibility of information from diverse sources (digital and print), taking effective notes, summarizing information accurately, avoiding plagiarism, and citing sources using a standard format (e.g., MLA basics).
*   (Where applicable via A.C.E. platform/groups) Participate effectively in discussions, present information clearly, and listen critically.

## Major Topics & Units (Indicative Sequence)

The 7th Grade Language Arts curriculum integrates skills across units typically covering:

1.  **Reading Comprehension Across Genres:** Strategies for analyzing informational texts (main idea, evidence, structure), literary texts (plot, character, theme), poetry (figurative language, sound devices), and drama (dialogue, stage directions).
2.  **Literary Analysis Fundamentals:** Identifying and explaining literary devices, analyzing character motivation and development, determining theme, comparing/contrasting different works or interpretations.
3.  **The Writing Process in Depth:** Emphasis on pre-writing strategies (brainstorming, outlining), drafting coherently, **substantive revision** (improving clarity, organization, support, style), and meticulous editing/proofreading for conventions.
4.  **Narrative Writing:** Developing engaging personal narratives and short fictional stories with clear structure (plot points), consistent point-of-view, descriptive language, and dialogue. (Reinforces LA-PW 101).
5.  **Expository & Informative Writing:** Crafting clear explanations, definitions, compare/contrast essays, and procedural descriptions with logical organization and supporting details.
6.  **Argumentative Writing Introduction:** Forming a clear claim/thesis, identifying relevant supporting evidence, basic organizational structures for arguments, acknowledging counterclaims (simple introduction).
7.  **Grammar & Mechanics Mastery:** Focused practice and application within writing assignments covering sentence complexity, effective punctuation usage, verb tense consistency, pronoun agreement, and common usage errors.
8.  **Vocabulary Development:** Strategies for determining word meaning from context, understanding Greek/Latin roots and affixes, using dictionaries/thesauruses effectively.
9.  **Foundational Research Skills:** Defining research questions, identifying credible sources (distinguishing from unreliable sources), basic note-taking methods (paraphrasing, summarizing, quoting), introduction to avoiding plagiarism and creating simple bibliographies/works cited pages.

## Methodology & Integration

Language Arts is engaged **daily** through a combination of readings (assigned texts, articles, examples), writing assignments (short responses, multi-paragraph essays, creative pieces), targeted grammar and vocabulary exercises, research tasks, and potentially online discussions or presentations via the A.C.E. platform. Emphasis is placed on applying learned concepts immediately in practical writing and analysis. Connections are made to monthly A.C.E. Skill Intensives where relevant (e.g., writing documentation for tech projects, scripting for media courses, analyzing texts in History).

## Assessment

Mastery of Language Arts objectives is assessed through:

*   **Writing Assignments:** Graded using rubrics focusing on clarity, organization, development, evidence/support, grammar/mechanics, and adherence to assignment purpose/audience.
*   **Reading Comprehension:** Assessed via quizzes, discussion responses, analytical paragraphs/essays demonstrating understanding of texts.
*   **Grammar & Vocabulary:** Quizzes and application within written work.
*   **Research Tasks:** Evaluation of source selection, note-taking quality, proper citation (basics), and synthesis of information.
*   **Participation:** Active engagement in discussions or collaborative tasks (where applicable).
*   **Portfolio Contributions:** Selected polished writing pieces contribute to the overall Portfolio of Execution.
*   **ARKTIK Benchmark Assessment (ABA):** Performance on the Language Arts section contributes to the year-end academic benchmark.
