# A.C.E. 7th Grade: Core Curriculum Overview

**Cycle:** 1 / **Year:** 2025

## Role & Purpose

Welcome to the Core Curriculum overview for the A.C.E. 7th Grade Homeschool Program. This essential component provides the foundational academic knowledge required for a comprehensive education, running **concurrently with the monthly A.C.E. Skill Intensives**.

The purpose of the Daily Core Curriculum is to:

1.  **Build Broad Academic Knowledge:** Ensure mastery of fundamental concepts and skills across key subjects typically required at the 7th-grade level.
2.  **Align with Educational Standards:** Provide content designed with the goal of aligning with or exceeding established external educational standards (such as the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills - TEKS), supporting academic validation and readiness for future educational pathways (higher A.C.E. levels, college).
3.  **Develop Critical Thinking & Literacy:** Foster analytical skills, reading comprehension, effective writing, and scientific/mathematical reasoning applicable across all domains.
4.  **Provide Context for Applied Skills:** Offer the theoretical knowledge and historical context that enriches the practical skills learned in the monthly Skill Intensives.

## Daily Engagement

Participants are expected to engage with Core Curriculum materials **daily**. This involves completing assigned readings, viewing instructional content (where applicable), participating in exercises or practice problems, and completing periodic assessments as outlined within each subject area. Consistent daily effort in these core subjects is crucial for building a strong foundation.

## 7th Grade Core Subjects

The following core academic subjects form the basis of the daily curriculum for 7th Grade. Click the links for detailed outlines, learning objectives, and expected standards for each subject:

*   **Language Arts 7:**
    *   Focus: Expanding reading comprehension across diverse texts, advanced grammar and composition, developing analytical and persuasive writing skills, vocabulary building.
    *   [Detailed Outline](./Language_Arts.md) 

*   **Mathematics 7:**
    *   Focus: Pre-Algebra concepts, integers, rational numbers, proportions, basic geometry introductions, data analysis fundamentals, problem-solving strategies. *(Note: GT students may follow an accelerated path aligned with MA-R 101).*
    *   [Detailed Outline](./Mathematics.md) 

*   **Science 7:**
    *   Focus: Life Science emphasis (cell biology, genetics, ecosystems, human body systems), scientific inquiry methods, basic chemistry/physics concepts related to life processes. *(Note: GT students may integrate concepts more deeply with SCI-S 101).*
    *   [Detailed Outline](./Science.md) 

*   **History 7:**
    *   Focus: Typically Texas History (aligning with TEKS) or potentially World History survey (Ancient Civilizations continued - aligning with HIST-iSTEAM). Emphasis on primary source analysis, historical thinking skills, understanding cause/effect. *(Note: GT students may integrate concepts more deeply with HIST-iSTEAM 101).*
    *   [Detailed Outline](./History.md) 

*   **(Potential Additional Subjects):** Depending on specific A.C.E. structure, introductory modules on Logic, Ethics, or foundational aspects of other Pathways may be integrated here.

## Assessment

Progress in the Core Curriculum is typically assessed through:

*   Completion of daily assignments and exercises.
*   Quizzes and tests covering subject matter content.
*   Short essays, reports, or presentations.
*   Participation in discussions (where applicable).
*   Results contribute to the overall A.C.E. progress evaluation alongside Skill Intensive performance. The **ARKTIK Benchmark Assessment (ABA)** at year-end specifically measures proficiency in these core academic areas against external standards.

## Connection to Skill Intensives

While distinct in rhythm (daily vs. monthly), the Core Curriculum and A.C.E. Skill Intensives are designed to be complementary. Strong skills in math support technical tracks, effective writing from Language Arts aids documentation and communication across all fields, and understanding history (especially iSTEAM) provides crucial context for current technological development. Participants are encouraged to actively make connections between their daily studies and their monthly practical execution work.

Consistent diligence in the Core Curriculum builds the essential knowledge base that empowers deeper mastery in the practical Skill Intensives.
