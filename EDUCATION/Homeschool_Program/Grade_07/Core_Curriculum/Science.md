# A.C.E. 7th Grade: Core Curriculum - Science

## Role & Purpose

Welcome to 7th Grade Science within the ARKTIK Curriculum for Education (A.C.E.). As a core academic subject engaged with **daily**, Science provides the framework for understanding the natural world through **observation, inquiry, and evidence-based reasoning**. This course builds essential knowledge in (typically) Life Science while honing critical thinking and analytical skills vital for navigating complex information and contributing to ARKTIK's mission, especially within the Sustainable Resources Pathway.

In A.C.E., Science emphasizes the **scientific method as a form of disciplined execution**. We focus on asking testable questions, designing simple investigations, collecting and analyzing data accurately (**Precision**), drawing logical conclusions based on evidence (**Integrity**), and communicating findings clearly. Understanding living systems fosters a deeper appreciation for **Stewardship** of creation. This curriculum is designed with the goal of aligning with or exceeding established educational standards, such as the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS), for 7th grade science.

*(Note: Gifted & Talented (GT) students may follow an enriched curriculum, potentially integrating more deeply with concepts from the SCI-S 101 track. See the GT Track documentation for details.)*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of 7th Grade Science, participants will demonstrate the ability to:

*   Apply safe practices during laboratory and field investigations (where applicable).
*   Use appropriate scientific tools (microscope basics, measurement tools) to collect data accurately.
*   Plan and implement simple descriptive or comparative investigations following steps of the scientific method.
*   Record quantitative and qualitative data methodically using tables, graphs, and written observations.
*   Analyze data, identify patterns/trends, and construct explanations based on evidence.
*   Differentiate between structure and function in living systems from cells to organisms.
*   Describe the basic processes of cell function, energy conversion (photosynthesis/respiration basics), and transport.
*   Explain the fundamental principles of heredity and genetic transmission of traits.
*   Understand basic concepts of biological classification.
*   Identify components of ecosystems and describe the flow of energy and matter (food chains/webs).
*   Explain how organisms adapt to their environment and the basic concept of natural selection.
*   Identify major human body systems and describe their primary functions and interactions.

## Major Topics & Units (Indicative Sequence - Life Science Focus)

The 7th Grade Science curriculum typically explores the fascinating world of living things, covering units such as:

1.  **The Nature of Science & Safety:**
    *   Topics: Scientific method/inquiry process, lab/field safety procedures, using scientific tools (measurement, microscope basics), distinguishing science from pseudoscience.
2.  **Characteristics of Living Things:**
    *   Topics: Defining life, basic needs of organisms, levels of organization (atoms to organisms).
3.  **Cells: The Basic Unit of Life:**
    *   Topics: Cell theory, structure and function of plant and animal cell organelles (nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, etc.), basic cell processes (transport, energy conversion).
4.  **Genetics & Heredity:**
    *   Topics: Introduction to DNA structure and function, genes and chromosomes, inherited vs. acquired traits, dominant/recessive traits, Punnett squares basics, mutations overview.
5.  **Classification & Biodiversity:**
    *   Topics: Need for classification, Linnaean system basics (Domains, Kingdoms, basic levels), distinguishing characteristics of major groups of organisms.
6.  **Ecosystems & Environment:**
    *   Topics: Biotic and abiotic factors, energy flow (producers, consumers, decomposers, food chains/webs), ecological relationships (symbiosis: mutualism, commensalism, parasitism), cycles of matter (water, carbon basics).
7.  **Adaptations & Change Over Time:**
    *   Topics: Structural and behavioral adaptations of organisms to specific environments, introduction to natural selection and evolution concepts.
8.  **Human Body Systems:**
    *   Topics: Overview of major systems (e.g., Skeletal, Muscular, Circulatory, Respiratory, Digestive, Nervous, Endocrine, Immune) and their primary functions and interdependencies for maintaining homeostasis.

## Methodology & Integration

Science is learned **daily** through a dynamic mix of readings, virtual labs/simulations, data analysis exercises, concept mapping, guided inquiry, and hands-on activities/observations where feasible within the homeschool environment (e.g., observing local ecosystems, simple experiments). The A.C.E. platform delivers core content and facilitates submission of work based on the 4-Phase cycle:
*   **Foundation:** Reading about concepts, viewing explanations.
*   **Application:** Answering conceptual questions, performing guided simulations/virtual labs.
*   **Execution:** Conducting simple investigations/observations, collecting/graphing data, writing lab summaries/conclusions based on evidence.
*   **Integration:** Connecting concepts (e.g., ecosystems to Sustainable Resources tracks, body systems to Health pathway, data analysis to Math). Emphasis on accurate data recording (**Precision**) and objective interpretation (**Integrity**).

## Assessment

Mastery of Science objectives is assessed through:

*   Completion and quality of daily assignments, practice questions, and lab/activity reports.
*   Performance on quizzes and unit tests covering concepts and vocabulary.
*   Accuracy and thoroughness in data collection, analysis, and graphical representation.
*   Ability to construct evidence-based explanations and conclusions.
*   Participation in discussions or collaborative inquiry tasks (where applicable).
*   Contribution to the science component of the **ARKTIK Benchmark Assessment (ABA)**.
*   Relevant work may contribute to the Portfolio of Execution.
