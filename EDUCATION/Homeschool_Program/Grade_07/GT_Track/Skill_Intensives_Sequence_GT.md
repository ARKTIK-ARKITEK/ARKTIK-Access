# A.C.E. 7th Grade Skill Intensives Sequence (GT Track - 2025 Cycle)

## Introduction

This document outlines the recommended sequence of **monthly A.C.E. Skill Intensives** (practical, execution-based courses) for participants identified for the **Gifted & Talented (GT) 7th Grade A.C.E. Homeschool Program** during the 2025 Cycle. These intensive courses are taken **one per month**, concurrently with the enriched **Daily GT Core Curriculum** studies.

The GT sequence is designed for accelerated learning, introducing more complex concepts and foundational Practitioner-level courses earlier than the standard track. It demands a higher level of independent work, critical thinking, and execution proficiency. Each Skill Intensive culminates in a significant **deliverable** for the participant's **Portfolio of Execution**.

*(Note: Some core GT courses like MA-R 101 and ENG-SYS 101 represent substantial learning spanning multiple months; this sequence indicates the primary focus intensive initiated each month.)*

## Important Notes

*   **Prerequisites:** Each Skill Intensive assumes mastery of previous courses and A.C.E. Phase 0. Specific technical prerequisites for `MA-R 101` and `ENG-SYS 101` are critical.
*   **Links:** Course Detail links point to the respective Course `README.md` files within the appropriate directory under `EDUCATION/Track/`. These target files must exist or be created at these paths.
*   **Rigor & Pace:** The GT track demands significant weekly time commitment for **both** the enriched Daily Core Curriculum **and** these advanced monthly Skill Intensives.
*   **Execution:** Successful completion of **all** monthly Skill Intensive deliverables, meeting high standards, is mandatory for progression.

This sequence provides a demanding yet enriching foundation, preparing A.C.E. GT 7th-grade participants for accelerated progression into Practitioner and Specialist tracks, equipped with advanced thinking skills and practical execution capabilities across multiple domains.
