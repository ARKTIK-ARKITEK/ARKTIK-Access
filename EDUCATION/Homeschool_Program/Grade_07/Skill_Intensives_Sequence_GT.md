# A.C.E. 7th Grade Skill Intensives Sequence (GT Track - 2025 Cycle)

## Introduction

This document outlines the recommended sequence of **monthly A.C.E. Skill Intensives** (practical, execution-based courses) for participants identified for the **Gifted & Talented (GT) 7th Grade A.C.E. Homeschool Program** during the 2025 Cycle. These intensive courses are taken **one per month**, concurrently with the **Daily GT Core Curriculum** studies.

The GT sequence is designed for accelerated learning, introducing more complex concepts and introductory Practitioner-level courses earlier than the standard 7th-grade track. It demands a higher level of independent work, critical thinking, and execution proficiency. Each Skill Intensive culminates in a significant **deliverable** for the participant's **Portfolio of Execution**, often requiring deeper analysis or more sophisticated application of skills. This pathway aims to build a strong foundation for advanced specialization in high school A.C.E. tracks.

*(Note: This is a recommended sequence; minor adjustments may be made based on cohort progress and individual aptitude, in consultation with A.C.E. advisors/mentors.)*

## Important Notes

*   **Prerequisites:** Each Skill Intensive assumes mastery of previous courses in the sequence and completion of A.C.E. Phase 0. Specific technical prerequisites (especially for MA-R and ENG-SYS) are critical.
*   **Links:** Course Detail links point to the respective Course `README.md` files. **Paths require final confirmation** based on where `MA-R 101`, `ENG-SYS 101`, `LA-PW 101`, `FILM-VS 101` etc. are ultimately housed (likely within their primary Track folders, e.g., Systems Steward, a future Engineering Track, Foundational Skills, Film/Cinema).
*   **Rigor & Pace:** The GT track demands significant weekly time commitment for *both* the enriched Daily Core Curriculum *and* the advanced monthly Skill Intensives. Expect a challenging but rewarding pace.
*   **Execution:** Successful completion of *all* monthly Skill Intensive deliverables, meeting high standards of quality and demonstrating deep understanding, is required for progression.

This sequence provides a demanding yet enriching foundation, preparing A.C.E. GT 7th-grade participants for accelerated progression into specialized Practitioner and Specialist tracks, equipped with advanced thinking skills and practical execution capabilities.
