# A.C.E. 7th Grade Skill Intensives Sequence (GT Track - 2025 Cycle)

## Introduction

This document outlines the recommended sequence of **monthly A.C.E. Skill Intensives** (practical, execution-based courses) for participants identified for the **Gifted & Talented (GT) 7th Grade A.C.E. Homeschool Program** during the 2025 Cycle. These intensive courses are taken **one per month**, concurrently with the enriched **Daily GT Core Curriculum** studies.

The GT sequence is designed for accelerated learning, introducing more complex concepts and foundational Practitioner-level courses earlier than the standard track. It demands a higher degree of independent work, critical thinking, and execution proficiency. Each Skill Intensive culminates in a significant **deliverable** for the participant's **Portfolio of Execution**.

*(Note: Some core GT courses like MA-R 101 and ENG-SYS 101, while listed within specific months to indicate their start, represent substantial learning that will likely span multiple months of dedicated effort alongside other Skill Intensives or Core Studies. This sequence reflects the primary *focus* intensive for each month.)*

## Important Notes

*   **Prerequisites:** Each Skill Intensive assumes mastery of previous courses and A.C.E. Phase 0. Specific technical/conceptual prerequisites for `MA-R 101` and `ENG-SYS 101` are critical and detailed in their respective Course READMEs.
*   **Links:** Course Detail links point to the respective Course `README.md` files within their primary Track folder structure (Foundational Skills, Systems Steward, etc.). These target files must exist.
*   **Rigor & Pace:** The GT track demands significant weekly time commitment for **both** the enriched Daily Core Curriculum **and** these advanced monthly Skill Intensives. Expect a challenging pace requiring strong self-direction and time management.
*   **Execution:** Successful completion of **all** monthly Skill Intensive deliverables, meeting high standards of quality and demonstrating deep understanding through Execution Gates, is mandatory for progression.

This sequence provides a challenging and integrated foundation, preparing A.C.E. GT 7th-grade participants for accelerated progression into Practitioner and Specialist tracks, equipped with advanced thinking skills and practical execution capabilities across multiple domains.
