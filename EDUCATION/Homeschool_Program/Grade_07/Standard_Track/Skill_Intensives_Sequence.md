# A.C.E. 7th Grade Skill Intensives Sequence (Standard Track - 2025 Cycle)

## Introduction

This document outlines the recommended sequence of **monthly A.C.E. Skill Intensives** (practical, execution-based courses) for participants in the **Standard 7th Grade A.C.E. Homeschool Program** during the 2025 Cycle. These intensive courses are taken **one per month**, concurrently with the **Daily Core Curriculum** studies (Language Arts, Math, Science, History).

Each Skill Intensive focuses on developing specific practical competencies through hands-on execution, culminating in a tangible **deliverable** that becomes part of the participant's **Portfolio of Execution**. This sequence aims to build foundational skills, instill A.C.E. work habits (discipline, accountability, quality), and provide broad exposure relevant to multiple A.C.E. Pathways, preparing students for more specialized Tracks starting in later grades.

## Important Notes

*   **Prerequisites:** Each listed Skill Intensive assumes successful completion of A.C.E. Phase 0 and generally follows the sequence shown. Specific technical prerequisites will be detailed in individual Course READMEs.
*   **Execution:** Successful completion of each monthly Skill Intensive, verified through its Execution Gate deliverable, is required for progression and contributes significantly to the overall A.C.E. assessment.

This sequence provides a broad and robust foundation across multiple domains, preparing 7th-grade participants for more specialized learning in subsequent A.C.E. years while reinforcing daily Core Curriculum studies and ARKTIK values through practical execution.
