# A.C.E. Shared Resources

Welcome to the Shared Resources directory for the **ARKTIK Curriculum for Education (A.C.E.)**.

## Purpose of this Directory

This directory contains supplementary materials, guidelines, templates, and tools that are potentially applicable across multiple **A.C.E. Pathways and Tracks**. While specific Tracks and Modules will contain their own focused resources, this section serves as a central repository for common assets that support learning, ensure consistency, and promote best practices throughout the A.C.E. ecosystem.

Utilizing these shared resources promotes **Efficiency**, **Consistency** (Craftsmanship), and **Transparency** across different learning programs, reflecting core ARKTIK values.

## Available Resource Categories

This directory is organized into subdirectories based on resource type:

*   **[`Glossary.md`](./Glossary.md):** Definitions of key terms used within ARKTIK, A.C.E., and potentially specific technical domains common across tracks. A living document aimed at ensuring clear communication.

*   **[`Style_Guides/`](./Style_Guides/):** Contains guidelines promoting consistency and quality in various outputs.
    *   *Examples:* Coding style guides (e.g., `Rust_Style.md`), documentation standards (`Documentation_Standard.md`), communication style guides.

*   **[`Templates/`](./Templates/):** Provides standardized templates for common documents and tasks produced during A.C.E. projects and execution gates.
    *   *Examples:* Project Proposal Template (`Project_Proposal.md`), Execution Report Template (`Execution_Report.md`), Meeting Agenda/Minutes Template, Basic Budget Worksheet.

*   **[`Tooling_Guides/`](./Tooling_Guides/):** Offers general setup instructions, best practices, or introductory guides for tools commonly used across multiple A.C.E. tracks.
    *   *Examples:* Git Workflow Guide (`Git_Workflow.md`), Codespaces Setup & Tips (`Codespaces_Setup.md`), Asana Basics (if not fully covered in BOA track early modules), Basic Security Best Practices.

*   **[`Ethical_Case_Studies/`](./Ethical_Case_Studies/):** A collection of case studies presenting ethical dilemmas relevant to technology, business, communication, or resource management within the ARKTIK context, potentially used across different tracks for discussion and analysis.

*   _(Other categories may be added as needed.)_

## Using These Resources

Participants and mentors across various A.C.E. tracks are encouraged to familiarize themselves with and utilize these shared resources as applicable. Adhering to common style guides and using standard templates promotes professionalism and facilitates easier review and collaboration. Track-specific READMEs or Module lessons will often refer back to resources located here.

## Contributing

Suggestions for new shared resources or improvements to existing ones can be proposed following the guidelines in the main A.C.E. `CONTRIBUTING.md` (link TBD). Maintaining high-quality, relevant shared resources is an act of **Stewardship** benefiting the entire ARKTIK learning community.
