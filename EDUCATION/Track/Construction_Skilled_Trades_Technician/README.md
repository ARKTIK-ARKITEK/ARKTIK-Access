**Associated A.C.E. Fees:**

1.  **Tool & Platform Access Fee:** This track involves significant use of **consumable materials** (lumber, fasteners, insulation, sealant, wire, pipe) and requires access to a wide array of **hand and power tools** during practical labs and projects. Depending on ARKTIK's provisioning model (shared workshop access vs. individual/team kits), a periodic **Tool & Platform Access Fee** *may* apply to cover the managed cost of consumables, tool maintenance/access, and safety equipment provision, plus operational overhead. This will be clearly defined in the A.C.E. Fee Schedule. *(Assumes major software licenses are not the primary cost driver here, unlike other tracks).*
2.  **Blockchain Credential Issuance Fee:** Upon successful completion, the standard, **universal nominal fee** applies for issuing your **ARKTIK Certified Sustainable Trades Technician** credential onto the blockchain.

*Please refer to the official **A.C.E. Fee Schedule** document (link TBD) for confirmation regarding any kit/consumable/tool access fees and the current Blockchain Issuance Fee.* Commitment Pathway participants review `ace_framework_overview.md` Sec 7.4 re: conditional validity.
