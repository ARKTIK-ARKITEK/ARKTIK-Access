# A.C.E. Skill Intensive: ACE-ENGSYS-101 - Engineering Design, Systems Thinking & GraphQL Introduction (GT)

**Track Alignment:** Design & Development Pathway (Core GT Foundational) | Supports Systems Steward, AI/Blockchain/Quantum, potentially others.
**Level:** Practitioner Start / GT Foundational (Typically starting Phase 2)
**Duration:** **Multi-Month Intensive Focus** (Equivalent to approx. 2 standard monthly Skill Intensives)

## Course Overview

### Purpose & Objectives

Welcome to **ACE-ENGSYS-101**, a pivotal course designed for ARKTIK's Gifted & Talented learners, integrating three crucial disciplines: the **Engineering Design Process (EDP)**, rigorous **Systems Thinking**, and an introduction to **GraphQL** as a modern paradigm for data interaction. This intensive, multi-month experience moves beyond isolated subjects to show how engineers approach complex problems systematically (EDP), analyze interconnected components (Systems Thinking), and design efficient ways to model and query the data underlying those systems (GraphQL Schema/Query Language). Participants develop a powerful analytical toolkit essential for designing, understanding, and building the resilient, integrated systems core to ARKTIK's mission, fostering **Precision** in thought and **Strategic Adaptability** in technical approach.

### Learning Objectives (Mapped to Deliverables)

Upon successful execution and completion of this multi-month course, participants will demonstrate the ability to:

*   Articulate and apply the iterative steps of the Engineering Design Process (EDP) to analyze problems and structure solutions conceptually.
*   Employ Systems Thinking principles to decompose complex systems (physical, digital, organizational) into components, interactions, inputs/outputs, boundaries, and feedback loops.
*   Develop precise problem definitions including Needs, Constraints, and Success Criteria for engineering challenges.
*   Explain the role of APIs in modern systems and differentiate the core approach of GraphQL (client-specified queries) from traditional REST limitations (over/under-fetching).
*   Read, interpret, and write basic GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) to model system data structures (types, fields, scalars, relationships, nullability).
*   Formulate effective GraphQL queries to retrieve specific, nested data from public GraphQL APIs or basic schema mockups using playground tools.
*   Connect the disciplined processes of engineering design and systems analysis directly to the need for precise data modeling using schemas (SDL).

### Primary Deliverable(s) (Execution Gate for Course Completion)

1.  **System Analysis & Problem Definition Portfolio:** A collection of documents applying EDP (especially Define step) and Systems Thinking principles to analyze several diverse ARKTIK-relevant scenarios or provided case studies. Must include component breakdowns, interaction maps, and precisely defined problem statements (Need/Constraints/Criteria).
2.  **GraphQL Schema Design & Query Examples:** For selected scenarios from the portfolio above, design basic GraphQL schemas (written in SDL) representing the core data entities and relationships. Include example GraphQL queries (tested against a playground or theoretical schema) demonstrating ability to fetch specific, relevant data based on the designed schema.
3.  **Integrated Mini-Project Proposal:** A detailed proposal document outlining a potential solution approach (using EDP steps) for one analyzed problem. Must include a system decomposition, defined success criteria, and a well-structured proposed GraphQL schema (SDL) for managing the project's core data entities.

### ARKTIK Value Integration

This course intensely cultivates:
*   **Precision:** Demanded by systematic EDP application, detailed systems analysis, and the strict syntax/logic of GraphQL SDL and queries.
*   **Integrity:** Objectively defining problems based on evidence; designing schemas that accurately represent system data; using "Truth over Feeling" in analysis.
*   **Stewardship:** Applying structured thinking to use design/development resources efficiently; designing data interactions thoughtfully.
*   **Resilience:** Using Systems Thinking to anticipate unintended consequences and design more robust, adaptable solutions. Designing APIs for efficient data access potentially enhances system resilience.
*   **Accountability:** Clearly defined problems and schemas create explicit benchmarks for design and implementation success.
*   **Strategic Adaptability:** Mastering modern paradigms like Systems Thinking and GraphQL prepares learners for future technological landscapes.

## Prerequisites

*   Successful completion of **A.C.E. Phase 0**.
*   Successful completion of **`ACE-FND-101: A.C.E. Orientation & Digital Workflow`**.
*   **Demonstrated strong analytical, logical reasoning, and abstract thinking skills** (GT placement criteria).
*   Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, data types, basic logic) is highly beneficial (e.g., via `ACE-TECH-102` or concurrent work in `ACE-MAR-101`).
*   Strong reading comprehension and ability to synthesize information from different sources.

## Required Tools, Platforms & Associated Fees

This course focuses on design, analysis, and querying concepts, primarily utilizing free and accessible digital tools.

**Essential Tools & Platforms (Generally Free Access):**
*   **Diagramming/Mapping Tools:** Browser-based tools like `draw.io` (diagrams.net), Lucidchart (free tier), or similar for creating system maps/flowcharts.
*   **GraphQL Playgrounds:** Publicly accessible online GraphQL environments (e.g., SpaceX API, GitHub API explorer, or instructor-provided examples) for query practice.
*   **Text Editor / Markdown Editor:** For writing SDL, queries, proposals, and analyses (VS Code within Codespaces is ideal).
*   **Standard Collaboration Suite:** Google Workspace / Microsoft 365 for documentation and potential group analysis work.
*   **Version Control:** Git/GitHub for managing proposal documents and schema files within Portfolio.

**Associated A.C.E. Fees:**

1.  **Tool & Platform Access Fee:** The core activities rely on free online tools (Playgrounds, Diagramming), standard text editors, and version control platforms with adequate free tiers. Therefore, a specific periodic Tool & Platform Access Fee is **NOT applicable** to ACE-ENGSYS-101.
2.  **Blockchain Credential Issuance Fee:** Applies only upon completion of full **Tracks** or specific Certificate Programs, **not** typically after single foundational/introductory courses like this one.

*Refer to the main `../../../ace_framework_overview.md` and the official A.C.E. Fee Schedule for details on overall program costs.*

## Learning Methodology

Following the A.C.E. 4-Phase cycle applied to design and analysis:
*   **Foundation:** Learning the steps of EDP, core Systems Thinking concepts (components, interactions, feedback), API fundamentals, GraphQL principles (query language, schema), and basic SDL syntax through readings, examples, and guided discussion.
*   **Application:** Practicing systems decomposition on familiar examples, drafting problem statements using the Need/Constraints/Criteria framework, writing basic GraphQL queries against public APIs, reading and interpreting simple SDL schemas.
*   **Execution:** Independently analyzing complex ARKTIK-relevant scenarios using Systems Thinking/EDP, designing appropriate basic GraphQL schemas (SDL) to model their data, formulating targeted queries, crafting the Mini-Project Proposal integrating these elements. Peer review of analyses and schema designs encouraged.
*   **Integration:** Reflecting on the deep connection between problem definition, system structure, and data modeling (schema design). Finalizing portfolio deliverables (analyses, schemas, proposal). Understanding how GraphQL facilitates efficient data flow in engineered systems.

## Learning Progression (Indicative - Spanning Multiple Months)
