**Essential Hardware:**
*   A **reasonably modern computer** (Windows or macOS) capable of running the Unity Editor smoothly (Check current Unity system requirements - requires dedicated graphics capabilities beyond basic integrated graphics).

**Associated A.C.E. Fees:**

1.  **Tool & Platform Access Fee:** This foundational track is designed primarily using free or community editions of essential software (Unity Personal, VS Community). Therefore, a specific periodic Tool & Platform Access Fee is **generally NOT applicable**, unless specific paid Unity Asset Store assets or services become integral later (unlikely for fundamentals). Confirm via A.C.E. Fee Schedule.
2.  **Blockchain Credential Issuance Fee:** Upon successful completion of the entire track, the standard, **universal nominal fee** applies for the issuance (minting) of your official **ARKTIK Certified Unity Foundations Developer (C#)** credential onto the blockchain.

*Please refer to the official **A.C.E. Fee Schedule** document (link TBD) for confirmation and the current Blockchain Issuance Fee amount.* Commitment Pathway participants review `ace_framework_overview.md` Sec 7.4 re: conditional validity.

## Learning Methodology

This Fast-Track adheres to the A.C.E. execution-based model (4-Phase Cycle) applied within intensive monthly courses:
*   **Integrated Learning:** C# programming fundamentals are taught in direct conjunction with their application inside the Unity Engine.
*   **Project-Driven:** Each month culminates in a specific, playable mini-project or functional prototype demonstrating the skills learned.
*   **Hands-On Tutorials & Challenges:** Step-by-step guidance mixed with independent coding challenges to solidify concepts.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** Focus on quickly building, testing, and refining simple interactive elements.
*   **Portfolio Focus:** Each monthly deliverable becomes a piece in the participant's foundational game development portfolio.
*   **Mentorship & Peer Review:** Access to guidance and feedback within the A.C.E. structure.
