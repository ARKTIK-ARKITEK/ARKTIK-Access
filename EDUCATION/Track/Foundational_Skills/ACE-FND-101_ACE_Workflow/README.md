## Course Overview

### Purpose & Objectives

Welcome to **ACE-FND-101**, the essential starting point for practical execution within the ARKTIK Curriculum for Education! This intensive one-month course solidifies your understanding of the A.C.E. execution-based model and ensures you master the **foundational digital workflow and tools** required for success across all future A.C.E. pathways. You will configure your personal **GitHub repository** (the base for your vital Portfolio of Execution), become proficient navigating **GitHub Codespaces** (your cloud development environment), master basic **Git commands** for version control, and learn to utilize **Asana** for personal task management and accountability. This course directly instills ARKTIK's core values of **Accountability, Transparency, Stewardship, and Precision** in your daily digital work habits.

### Learning Objectives (Mapped to Deliverables)

Upon successful execution and completion of this course, you will demonstrate the ability to:

*   Articulate the A.C.E. execution-based learning model (4-Phase Cycle) and its connection to ARKTIK values.
*   Set up, initialize, and configure a personal GitHub repository according to A.C.E. standards to serve as your initial Portfolio of Execution.
*   Reliably launch, navigate the interface of, utilize the integrated terminal within, and perform basic file management tasks inside GitHub Codespaces.
*   Execute fundamental Git commands (`clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `branch`, `checkout`, basic `merge`) correctly via the command line within Codespaces.
*   Write clear, concise, and informative commit messages adhering to the Conventional Commits format standard.
*   Set up an Asana project and utilize its basic features (tasks, subtasks, due dates, sections, status updates) to manage your personal A.C.E. coursework and track progress.
*   Organize files and create basic documentation (README.md using Markdown) within your GitHub repository according to ARKTIK guidelines for digital stewardship.
*   Reflect on and articulate how disciplined use of these tools embodies specific ARKTIK principles.

### Primary Deliverable(s) (Execution Gate)

1.  **Configured Portfolio Repository (GitHub):** Your personal GitHub repo, correctly named and initialized. Must contain:
    *   A well-formatted main `README.md` introducing yourself and your A.C.E. journey (using Markdown).
    *   A basic, logical folder structure (e.g., folders for different courses or project types).
    *   A verifiable Git history demonstrating at least one feature branch created, committed to (with multiple, well-formatted commit messages), pushed, and successfully merged back to the `main` branch via Codespaces terminal commands.
2.  **Personal A.C.E. Task Board (Asana):** A properly configured Asana project board containing:
    *   Tasks representing the key assignments and deliverables for THIS course (`ACE-FND-101`).
    *   Appropriate use of sections (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed), due dates, and status updates reflecting your actual progress during the final week.
3.  **A.C.E. Workflow Reflection:** A Markdown document (`REFLECTION.md`) within your Portfolio Repository summarizing your understanding of the A.C.E. 4-Phase cycle, the specific function of Git, GitHub, Codespaces, and Asana in this workflow, and explicit connections showing how using these tools with discipline aligns with at least three core ARKTIK values (e.g., Accountability, Transparency, Stewardship, Precision).

### ARKTIK Value Integration

This course is explicitly designed to instill:
*   **Accountability:** Every Git commit creates a permanent record; Asana tracks task completion.
*   **Transparency:** Clear commit messages and visible Asana tasks make progress understandable.
*   **Stewardship:** Learning to manage your digital workspace (Codespaces), project history (Git/GitHub), and personal tasks (Asana) responsibly.
*   **Precision:** Following workflow steps accurately, writing correct commands, adhering to commit message formats.
*   **Efficiency:** Mastering standard tools to streamline your learning and execution process.
*   **Integrity:** Honestly representing your work through commits and task updates.

## Learning Methodology

This intensive course uses the A.C.E. 4-Phase cycle applied through practical execution:
*   **Foundation:** Understanding A.C.E.'s execution philosophy, the purpose of version control, cloud development environments, and task management. Reviewing relevant Phase 0 value concepts.
*   **Application:** Step-by-step guided labs and tutorials walking through GitHub setup, Codespaces launch/navigation, core Git commands (`clone`, `status`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `branch`, `checkout`, `merge`), Asana project/task creation, and basic Markdown formatting.
*   **Execution:** Independent completion of practice exercises and the primary deliverable tasks (setting up repo, managing Asana board, performing Git workflow accurately). Rigorous adherence to steps and standards is required. Troubleshooting common issues (e.g., simple merge conflicts, commit message formatting) is part of the process.
*   **Integration:** Writing the reflection document, organizing the portfolio repository, understanding how this workflow underpins all future A.C.E. practical work.
