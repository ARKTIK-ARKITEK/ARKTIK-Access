# A.C.E. Skill Intensive: ACE-LEAD-101 - Introduction to Teamwork & Collaboration

**Track Alignment:** Foundational Skills (Core) | Supports All Pathways
**Level:** Foundational (Phase 1)
**Duration:** 1 Month Intensive (Approx. 8-12 Hours Execution Expected Weekly)

## Course Overview

### Purpose & Objectives

Welcome to **ACE-LEAD-101**, a foundational Skill Intensive focused on mastering the principles and practices of effective **teamwork and collaboration** within the ARKTIK value system. Much of ARKTIK's mission is achieved through collective effort; learning to work together constructively, reliably, and ethically is therefore essential. This course explores communication dynamics in groups, shared responsibility, techniques for providing and receiving feedback, understanding basic team roles, and utilizing digital tools to coordinate shared work effectively. Participants will practice applying ARKTIK values like **Empathy, Accountability, and Transparency** in a collaborative setting, laying the groundwork for successful participation in team projects across all A.C.E. pathways.

### Learning Objectives (Mapped to Deliverables)

Upon successful execution and completion of this course, you will demonstrate the ability to:

*   Articulate the benefits and challenges of teamwork within the ARKTIK context.
*   Apply principles of effective communication (active listening, clarity) within a group setting.
*   Provide and receive constructive feedback according to basic ARKTIK guidelines.
*   Collaboratively define basic team roles, communication norms, and shared goals for a simple project (Team Charter).
*   Utilize shared digital documents and basic task management tools (e.g., Asana shared project) to coordinate group work.
*   Fulfill assigned responsibilities reliably within a simulated team environment.
*   Reflect on personal contributions and team dynamics, applying ARKTIK values (Empathy, Accountability, Selflessness).

### Primary Deliverable(s) (Execution Gate)

1.  **Team Charter (Group Simulation):** As part of a small group, collaboratively create a concise Team Charter document for a provided simulated project. The charter must define basic roles/responsibilities, agreed-upon communication methods/frequency, shared goals, and ground rules reflecting ARKTIK values. (Submitted via shared document).
2.  **Individual Reflection on Collaboration:** A written piece analyzing your personal experience during the group simulation. Must address contributions made, challenges faced, specific examples of applying (or struggling to apply) values like Empathy or Accountability in the team context, and lessons learned about effective collaboration. (Submitted via Portfolio Repo).
3.  **Documented Task Contribution:** Verifiable evidence (e.g., committed contributions to shared documents, completed assigned tasks tracked in Asana) demonstrating fulfillment of individual responsibilities within the group simulation activity.

### ARKTIK Value Integration

This course is a practical application of key ARKTIK values in a group context:
*   **Empathy & Selflessness:** Actively listening to teammates, considering different perspectives, offering support, prioritizing group success.
*   **Accountability:** Reliably completing assigned tasks on time, taking ownership of contributions (positive or negative).
*   **Transparency:** Communicating clearly and openly within the team, making progress visible (e.g., via Asana).
*   **Integrity:** Providing honest feedback respectfully, fulfilling commitments made to the team.
*   **Resilience:** Working together constructively to overcome challenges or disagreements that arise during collaboration.
*   **Community Focus:** Understanding how effective teamwork directly enables the achievement of larger community goals.

## Prerequisites

*   Successful completion of **A.C.E. Phase 0: ARKTIK Foundations & Digital Readiness**.
*   Successful completion of **`ACE-COMM-101: Effective Digital Communication`** is highly recommended for foundational communication skills.
*   Familiarity with basic task management concepts (potentially from `ACE-FND-101` or `ACE-BOA-102`).
*   Willingness to engage actively and respectfully with peers in group activities.

## Required Tools, Platforms & Associated Fees

This course utilizes standard digital collaboration and communication tools readily available within A.C.E.

**Essential Tools & Platforms (Generally Free Access / ARKTIK Provided):**
*   **Collaboration Suite:** Google Workspace / Microsoft 365 (especially Docs/Sheets for shared editing).
*   **Task Management:** Asana (Basic tier sufficient for shared project/task tracking taught here).
*   **Communication Platforms:** ARKTIK's standard platform (e.g., Slack, Teams) for group chat/coordination.
*   **Video Conferencing:** For simulated team meetings (Google Meet, Teams).

**Associated A.C.E. Fees:**

1.  **Tool & Platform Access Fee:** The tools required for ACE-LEAD-101 are standard digital platforms typically available via free tiers or included within ARKTIK's operational infrastructure. Therefore, a specific Tool & Platform Access Fee is **NOT applicable** to this course.
2.  **Blockchain Credential Issuance Fee:** Applies only upon completion of full **Tracks** or specific Certificate Programs, **not** typically after single foundational courses like this one.

*Refer to the main `../../../../ace_framework_overview.md` and the official A.C.E. Fee Schedule for details on overall program costs.*

## Learning Methodology

Following the A.C.E. 4-Phase cycle, this intensive focuses on practicing collaborative skills:
*   **Foundation:** Understanding teamwork theories, ARKTIK values in collaboration, communication models for groups, basics of team roles/dynamics.
*   **Application:** Guided exercises in active listening, providing structured feedback, analyzing teamwork case studies, practicing with collaborative features of Docs/Asana.
*   **Execution:** Participating actively and responsibly in the **structured group simulation project** to produce the Team Charter and fulfill assigned tasks. Writing the Individual Reflection based on this experience.
*   **Integration:** Group discussion/debrief of the simulation, connecting experiences back to principles, finalizing portfolio deliverables (Reflection, evidence of contribution).

## Weekly Breakdown (Indicative)

*   **Week 1: Why Teamwork? ARKTIK Values & Communication:** Benefits/Challenges of Teams; Explicit focus on Empathy, Selflessness, Accountability in group work; Communication Styles Review; Active Listening Practice. *Execution: Analyze teamwork scenarios.*
*   **Week 2: Effective Group Dynamics & Tools:** Giving/Receiving Constructive Feedback; Basic Conflict Awareness; Intro to Team Roles; Utilizing Shared Docs for real-time collaboration; Intro to Asana for Shared Project/Task Tracking. *Execution: Practice feedback; Collaborative document editing task.*
*   **Week 3: Planning Collaboration - The Team Charter:** Defining Shared Goals; Establishing Communication Norms & Ground Rules; Basic Role Definition; Group Simulation Kick-off - collaboratively drafting the Team Charter using shared tools. *Execution: Work with group on Team Charter using shared Doc/Asana.*

## Assessment & Mastery (Execution Gate)

Mastery for this foundational course is assessed based on both collaborative process and individual reflection/contribution:

1.  **Quality of Team Charter (Group Deliverable):** Evaluation of the collaboratively created charter for clarity, completeness, and reflection of ARKTIK principles for teamwork.
2.  **Evidence of Individual Contribution:** Verifiable completion of tasks assigned during the simulation (tracked via Asana/shared docs) demonstrating reliability (**Accountability**).
3.  **Quality of Individual Reflection:** Assessment of the written reflection for thoughtfulness, self-awareness regarding collaborative strengths/weaknesses, and specific examples of applying (**Empathy, Accountability, Selflessness**, etc.) or learning about ARKTIK values in the team context.

## Core Technologies Covered

Collaborative Document Editing (Google Docs / M365 Word Online), Task Management (**Asana Basics for Teams** - Shared Projects, Tasks, Assignees, Due Dates), Team Communication Platforms (Slack/Teams basics), Video Conferencing Tools.

## Next Steps

**ACE-LEAD-101** provides indispensable skills for participation in **any** subsequent A.C.E. track that involves group projects, team-based execution, or leadership development. It is particularly crucial preparation for the **Project Management Practitioner**, **Faith-Based Leadership**, and any Capstone Execution phases requiring collaboration.
