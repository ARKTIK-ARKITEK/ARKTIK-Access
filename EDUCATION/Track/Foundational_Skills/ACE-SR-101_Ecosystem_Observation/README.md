*   **Recording:** Pen/Pencil for physical journal; Keyboard for digital. Basic sketching tools (pencil, colored pencils optional).
*   **Visual Documentation:** Basic camera (smartphone camera sufficient).
*   **Basic Measurement Tools (Optional but helpful):** Thermometer, simple rain gauge (can be DIY), ruler/tape measure.
*   **Field Guides (Optional):** Access to local field guides (birds, plants, insects - library or online resources) for identification practice.
*   **Standard Collaboration Suite:** For accessing materials and submitting deliverables.

**Associated A.C.E. Fees:**

1.  **Tool & Platform Access Fee:** The core activities rely on observation, journaling, and basic tools readily available or low-cost. Therefore, a specific periodic Tool & Platform Access Fee is **NOT applicable** to ACE-SR-101. Participants are responsible for their own basic supplies like notebooks/pens or ensuring they have access to a suitable device for digital journaling/photos.
2.  **Blockchain Credential Issuance Fee:** Applies only upon completion of full **Tracks** or specific Certificate Programs, **not** typically after single foundational courses like this one.
