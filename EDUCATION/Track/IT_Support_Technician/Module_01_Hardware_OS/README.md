# ACE-ITS-101: Hardware & Operating System Fundamentals

**(Module 1 of A.C.E. Track: IT Support Technician)**
**Level:** Foundational (Phase 1)
**Duration:** 1 Month Intensive (Approx. 10-15 Hours Execution Expected Weekly)

## Module Overview

### Purpose and Role

Welcome to **ACE-ITS-101**, the foundational module initiating your journey in the **IT Support Technician Track**. This crucial first technical intensive lays the groundwork for understanding the physical machinery and core software that power modern computing. Participants will gain essential hands-on familiarity with identifying, assembling, and diagnosing basic issues with **computer hardware components**, coupled with the practical skills needed to install, configure, and navigate common **Operating Systems (OS)**, specifically Windows and Linux fundamentals. Mastering these basics provides the bedrock for all subsequent IT support troubleshooting and ensures adherence to ARKTIK's values of **Precision** and **Stewardship** when handling technical equipment and systems.

### Alignment with ARKTIK Values

This module emphasizes:
*   **Stewardship:** Careful handling and respect for physical computer components and digital system resources.
*   **Precision:** Following correct assembly procedures, accurate OS configuration, methodical troubleshooting steps.
*   **Integrity:** Adhering to safety protocols consistently, reporting hardware/software status accurately.
*   **Resilience:** Understanding how functional hardware and properly configured OS contribute to reliable systems.
*   **Foundation Building:** Establishing the essential technical knowledge required for effective support.
*   **Safety:** Rigorous adherence to Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) prevention and physical safety during hardware interaction.

### Duration

*   Approximately **1 Month Intensive** (Significant hands-on lab/simulation time).

## Prerequisites

*   Successful completion of **A.C.E. Phase 0: ARKTIK Foundations & Digital Readiness**.
*   Basic computer usage familiarity (keyboard, mouse, basic file concepts).
*   **Commitment to following safety procedures meticulously is non-negotiable.**
*   Attention to detail and ability to follow technical instructions.

## Required Tools, Platforms & Associated Fees

This foundational module utilizes standard computer components and widely available operating systems, often via simulation or educational licenses.

**Essential Tools & Platforms (Access facilitated via A.C.E. labs/resources or requires personal setup validation):**
*   **Hardware Components:** Access for identification and assembly/disassembly practice (physical lab kits preferred, high-quality simulations acceptable).
*   **Operating Systems:** Windows (current Desktop version - evaluation/education license likely sufficient), Linux Desktop (e.g., Ubuntu LTS - free).
*   **Virtualization Software:** Recommended for safe OS installation practice (e.g., VirtualBox - free, VMware Workstation Player - free).
*   **Basic Computer Toolkit:** Screwdrivers, ESD wrist strap (mandatory for physical hardware labs).
*   **Standard Collaboration Suite:** For accessing materials, documentation (Google Workspace/M365).

**Associated A.C.E. Fees:**

1.  **Tool & Platform Access Fee:** This foundational module primarily uses standard operating systems (often available via free/evaluation/edu licenses) and potentially free virtualization software. While physical hardware labs involve costs, these are typically handled as part of overall A.C.E. infrastructure or potentially via a one-time lab kit fee rather than a recurring subscription. Therefore, a specific periodic Tool & Platform Access Fee is **generally NOT applicable** to ACE-ITS-101 unless specialized simulation software with licensing costs is mandated. Confirm details via the official A.C.E. Fee Schedule regarding any potential lab kit fees.
2.  **Blockchain Credential Issuance Fee:** Applies only upon completion of full **Tracks** or specific Certificate Programs, **not** after single foundational courses like this one.

*Please refer to the official **A.C.E. Fee Schedule** document and `../../../../ace_framework_overview.md` for details on overall program costs.*

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful execution and completion of this module, you will demonstrate the ability to:

*   Identify common internal/external computer hardware components and explain their basic functions.
*   Safely assemble and disassemble a standard desktop computer system following ESD precautions.
*   Identify and interpret basic BIOS/UEFI settings and POST diagnostic information.
*   Diagnose and propose solutions for common, fundamental hardware boot issues.
*   Install both Windows (current version) and a designated Linux distribution successfully.
*   Navigate the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and perform basic configuration tasks in both Windows and Linux.
*   Execute fundamental file management and system information commands using the command line (CLI) in both Windows and Linux.
*   Perform basic user account management in both operating systems.
*   Explain the core purpose of an operating system and basic file system concepts (NTFS, ext4).

## Module Structure & Key Topics

This module integrates hardware fundamentals with essential OS skills:

1.  **Hardware Components & Terminology:** CPU, RAM, Motherboard, Storage (HDD/SSD/NVMe), PSU, Expansion Cards, Peripherals, Connectors/Cables - Identification and Function.
2.  **Safety Procedures & PC Assembly:** ESD Prevention (Critical), Tool Usage Best Practices, Systematic Assembly/Disassembly Process for Desktop PCs.
3.  **System Boot Process & Diagnostics:** BIOS/UEFI Interface Navigation, Boot Order Configuration, POST Codes/Beep Codes Interpretation, Basic Hardware Troubleshooting Steps (e.g., checking connections, reseating components).
4.  **Operating System Installation:** Installation Methods (USB), Partitioning Concepts (Basic), Dual Boot Concepts (Overview), Step-by-step guided installation of Windows and Linux (Ubuntu LTS Recommended).
5.  **Windows Desktop Environment:** Navigating the interface (Start Menu, Taskbar, File Explorer, Settings/Control Panel), Basic Customization, User Account Control (UAC), File System Navigation.
6.  **Linux Desktop Environment (Ubuntu LTS Focus):** Navigating GNOME/alternative DE, File Manager, System Settings, Software Installation Concepts (APT basics), File System Navigation.
7.  **Command Line Interface (CLI) Essentials:** Introduction to Windows CMD/PowerShell and Linux Bash. Core commands for navigation (`cd`, `pwd`), listing (`dir`/`ls`), file/directory manipulation (`copy`/`cp`, `move`/`mv`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`/`del`), and obtaining system information (`ipconfig`/`ifconfig`). Administrative privileges (`Run as Admin`/`sudo`).

## Learning Activities & Methodology

Following the A.C.E. 4-Phase cycle, this module is intensely hands-on:
*   **Foundation:** Reading technical specifications, watching procedural videos (assembly, installation), understanding safety protocols.
*   **Application:** Guided labs involving component identification, safe handling practice, step-by-step assembly/disassembly (physical or simulated), OS installation in virtual machines (highly recommended for repeatable practice).
*   **Execution:** Independently assembling a functional system (or completing simulation), performing OS installations from scratch, navigating both OS environments via GUI and CLI to complete specific tasks, diagnosing introduced hardware faults. Documenting procedures rigorously.
*   **Integration:** Reflecting on the relationship between hardware components and OS function, understanding troubleshooting logic, contributing lab documentation to the Portfolio of Execution.
