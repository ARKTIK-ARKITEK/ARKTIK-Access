*   **Basic Tools:** ESD strap, basic computer toolkit (screwdrivers, etc.).

**Associated A.C.E. Fees:**

1.  **Tool & Platform Access Fee:** This foundational track is designed primarily using readily available operating systems (Linux, Windows evaluation/edu licenses) and free or simulated software tools. Significant recurring external software license costs per participant are **not typically required**. Therefore, a specific periodic Tool & Platform Access Fee is **generally NOT applicable**, although minimal lab fees for physical component access/consumables might be addressed separately via ARKTIK initiative budgets. Confirm details via the official A.C.E. Fee Schedule.
2.  **Blockchain Credential Issuance Fee:** Upon successful completion of the entire track, the standard, **universal nominal fee** applies for the issuance (minting) of your official **ARKTIK Certified IT Support Technician** credential onto the blockchain.

*Please refer to the official **A.C.E. Fee Schedule** document (link TBD) for confirmation and the current Blockchain Issuance Fee amount.* Commitment Pathway participants review `ace_framework_overview.md` Sec 7.4 re: conditional validity.

## Learning Methodology

Following the A.C.E. execution-based model (4-Phase Cycle), this track is intensely hands-on:
*   **Practical Labs:** Assembling/disassembling hardware, installing/configuring operating systems (VMs heavily used for safe practice), setting up basic networks.
*   **Troubleshooting Simulations:** Diagnosing and fixing intentionally introduced faults in hardware, OS, software, and network scenarios under time constraints (where applicable).
*   **Support Role-Playing:** Practicing communication techniques for handling common user support requests and issues effectively and empathetically.
