# A.C.E. Learning Program Catalog

Welcome to the central catalog for all learning programs within the **ARKTIK Curriculum for Education (A.C.E.)**. This document lists the available **Tracks** and **Sequences** designed to cultivate mastery and prepare participants for execution-based contribution.

These programs serve **both homeschool students (Grades 6-12) and adult learners/professionals**. They are designed primarily to equip individuals with **high-value, execution-proven skills for domestic US careers and entrepreneurship (supporting onshoring)**, while also cultivating talent deeply aligned with ARKTIK's mission and values.

## Understanding A.C.E. Programs

A.C.E. utilizes **Tracks** and **Skill Intensives** (monthly courses) to structure learning:

*   **A.C.E. Skill Intensives:** Intensive, one-month courses focused on mastering specific practical competencies through execution, culminating in a major deliverable. These are the building blocks.
*   **A.C.E. Tracks:** Curated sequences of recommended Skill Intensives, guiding learners progressively towards mastery in a specific role or discipline. Tracks provide structure and typically span from **Foundational** (entry-level skills) through **Practitioner** (professional competence) to **Specialist/Advanced** levels (deep expertise). Some may be designated **(GT)** for enriched content.
*   **Framework:** All programs operate within the principles outlined in the main **[`../ace_framework_overview.md`](../ace_framework_overview.md)**, including the dual engagement models (Commitment/Tuition), fee structures, validation methods (Portfolio, ARKTIK Endorsement), and value integration.

Consider programs that:
1.  Offer skills relevant to your target **US job market** or entrepreneurial goals.
2.  Align with your **personal aptitudes** and interests.
