# A.C.E. Skill Intensive: ACE-MAR-101 - Algebraic Foundations & Computational Logic with Rust (GT)

**Track Alignment:** Systems Steward - Rust (Core) | Foundational for GT pathways in Design & Development, AI/Blockchain/Quantum
**Level:** Practitioner Start / GT Foundational (Typically starting Phase 2)
**Duration:** **Multi-Month Intensive Focus** (Equivalent to approx. 2-3 standard monthly Skill Intensives)

## Course Overview

### Purpose & Objectives

Welcome to **ACE-MAR-101**, a cornerstone course in the ARKTIK GT pathway, uniquely designed to forge a deep, integrated understanding of **Algebraic Foundations** and **Computational Logic** using the **Rust programming language**. This intensive, multi-month experience moves beyond traditional mathematics by immediately translating algebraic principles (expressions, equations, functions) into precise, executable Rust code. Participants will master not only core Algebra I concepts but also foundational Rust programming, learning how the rigor and structure of each discipline reinforce the other. The goal is to cultivate **analytical thinkers and precise executors** capable of modeling problems mathematically and implementing solutions computationally with integrity and efficiency, embodying ARKTIK's commitment to **Mastery** and **Execution**.

### Learning Objectives (Mapped to Deliverables)

Upon successful execution and completion of this multi-month course, participants will demonstrate the ability to:

*   Apply properties of real numbers and order of operations accurately in both algebraic simplification and Rust code.
*   Write, compile, test, and debug foundational Rust programs involving variables, diverse data types (integers, floats, booleans), mutability control, and standard operators (arithmetic, comparison, boolean).
*   Implement basic console Input/Output (I/O) in Rust, including parsing string input into numeric types with basic error handling.
*   Solve complex multi-step linear equations and inequalities algebraically and implement corresponding solvers or validators in Rust using functions and control flow (`if`/`else`, loops).
*   Define, analyze, and represent mathematical functions (focus on linear) both algebraically and through Rust functions.
*   Solve systems of linear equations using various methods and potentially implement basic computational approaches.
*   Translate real-world problems into algebraic models (equations, functions, systems) and implement these models computationally in Rust.
*   Write clear mathematical justifications for algebraic steps and document Rust code effectively according to ARKTIK standards.
*   Manage Rust projects using Cargo and version control using Git/GitHub consistently.

### Primary Deliverable(s) (Execution Gate for Course Completion)

1.  **Portfolio of Integrated Rust Programs:** A curated collection within the main Portfolio of Execution (GitHub) showcasing multiple functional Rust programs that solve specific algebraic problems covered in the course (e.g., custom expression evaluator, linear equation solver, function plotter generating data points, system of equations solver for 2 variables). Code must be well-commented, tested where applicable (basic unit tests), and adhere to foundational ARKTIK Rust Style principles.
2.  **Mathematical Justification & Code Walkthrough Document(s):** Accompanying Markdown documents explaining the algebraic principles underlying the code for key programs, justifying the algorithms used, and walking through the Rust implementation logic.
3.  **Integrated Mini-Project:** Successful completion of a defined project requiring both algebraic modeling of a scenario (e.g., simple physics simulation, financial projection) and its implementation as a functional Rust application, demonstrating synthesis of mathematical and computational skills.

### ARKTIK Value Integration

This course intensely cultivates:
*   **Precision:** Demanded by both rigorous mathematical proof/calculation and Rust's strict type system and compiler.
*   **Integrity:** Ensuring logical consistency between mathematical models and code implementation; writing truthful justifications and documentation.
*   **Mastery:** Achieving deep, interconnected understanding of both algebraic principles and foundational programming logic.
*   **Execution:** Translating abstract mathematical concepts into working, verifiable computational solutions.
*   **Stewardship:** Writing clean, maintainable code and clearly documenting mathematical reasoning.
*   **Resilience:** Building robust problem-solving skills applicable to complex technical challenges.

## Prerequisites

*   Successful completion of **A.C.E. Phase 0**.
*   Passed **ACE-FND-101: A.C.E. Orientation & Digital Workflow** (Git/GitHub/Codespaces proficiency essential).
*   **Demonstrated high aptitude for mathematical reasoning and abstract/logical thinking** (Mandatory - typically via GT placement assessment or equivalent validation). Pre-Algebra concepts should be mastered.
*   Commitment required for an intensive, multi-month engagement demanding significant effort in both math and programming.

## Required Tools, Platforms & Associated Fees

This course focuses on open-source programming tools and standard digital platforms.

**Essential Tools & Platforms (Generally Free Access):**
*   **Rust Toolchain:** Stable Rust compiler (`rustc`), Cargo (build tool/package manager), Rust Analyzer (IDE support).
*   **IDE/Environment:** GitHub Codespaces (Recommended) or a local setup with VS Code (with rust-analyzer) / JetBrains RustRover/CLion.
*   **Version Control:** Git / GitHub Account.
*   **Documentation:** Markdown editor (integrated in IDE or standalone).
*   **Standard Collaboration Suite:** For accessing materials, communication.

**Associated A.C.E. Fees:**

1.  **Tool & Platform Access Fee:** The core Rust development tools are free and open-source, and platforms like GitHub/Codespaces offer sufficient free tiers for this course's expected workload. Therefore, a specific periodic Tool & Platform Access Fee is **NOT applicable** to ACE-MAR-101.
2.  **Blockchain Credential Issuance Fee:** Applies only upon completion of full **Tracks** or specific Certificate Programs, **not** typically after single courses, even multi-month ones like this. A potential future "Computational Mathematics Certificate" might trigger this fee if defined later.

*Refer to the main `../../../../ace_framework_overview.md` and the official A.C.E. Fee Schedule for details on overall program costs and Track completion credential fees.*

## Learning Methodology

Following the A.C.E. 4-Phase cycle applied rigorously across integrated mathematical and computational topics:
*   **Foundation:** Deep exploration of algebraic principles coupled with introduction to corresponding Rust syntax and concepts. Emphasis on the 'why' behind both math rules and code structures.
*   **Application:** Solving algebraic problems manually *and* immediately translating those solution processes into Rust functions/programs. Guided labs focus on specific Rust features (control flow, functions, types) applied to mathematical contexts.
*   **Execution:** Independent development of Rust programs to solve increasingly complex algebraic challenges. Rigorous debugging of both mathematical logic and Rust code errors. Mandatory testing (manual checks or basic unit tests) and clear code documentation/mathematical justification. Commit frequently with clear messages.
*   **Integration:** Reflecting on the synergy between mathematical precision and computational rigor. Building the portfolio pieces. Applying concepts to the integrated mini-project. Peer code review focused on both correctness and clarity.

## Learning Progression (Indicative - Spanning Multiple Months)

This course covers foundational Algebra I integrated with Rust fundamentals, likely requiring focus across 2-3 consecutive monthly A.C.E. Skill Intensive slots:

*   **Block 1 Focus:** Review Real Number Properties computationally; Master Rust Variables, Data Types, Mutability, Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Boolean), Order of Operations; Implement Basic Rust I/O & Parsing. (Aligns roughly w/ MA-R W1 L1/L2 + extensions).
*   **Block 2 Focus:** Solve Complex Linear Equations & Inequalities (Multi-step, Absolute Value, Compound) algebraically and implement Rust solvers using functions and conditional logic (`if`/`else`, `match`). Introduce Rust loops (`loop`, `while`, `for`).
*   **Block 3 Focus:** Define & Analyze Functions (Math concept & Rust `fn`); Deep dive into Linear Functions (Slope, Graphing Concepts -> data plotting, Writing Equations); Solve Systems of Linear Equations (Algebraic methods & computational implementation in Rust). Final integrated project execution.

*(Note: Topics like Polynomials, Factoring, Quadratics are typically deferred to a subsequent `ACE-MAR-102` course).*
