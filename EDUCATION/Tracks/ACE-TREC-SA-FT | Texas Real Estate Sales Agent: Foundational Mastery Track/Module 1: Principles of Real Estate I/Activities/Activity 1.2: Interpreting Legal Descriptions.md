# Activity 1.2: Interpreting Legal Descriptions

## Objective

This activity provides practice in recognizing and interpreting the two primary methods of legal land description used in Texas: Lot and Block (Recorded Plat) and Metes and Bounds. You will analyze sample excerpts and identify key components.

## Instructions

1.  Review the two exercises below, each containing an excerpt of a legal description.
2.  Answer the specific questions asked for each exercise.
3.  Focus on identifying the type of description, its key elements, and the implications, especially considering potential Commercial/Agricultural (Comm/Ag) contexts.
4.  Format your answers clearly, addressing each question number.
5.  Submit your completed answers as instructed in the corresponding Asana task.

## Exercise 1: Lot and Block (Recorded Plat) Description

**Excerpt:**

> "Lot 5, Block B, Phase Two, SHADY ACRES SUBDIVISION, a subdivision in Travis County, Texas, according to the map or plat thereof recorded in Document No. 202300123, Official Public Records of Travis County, Texas."

**Questions:**

1.  What type of legal description method is primarily used here?
2.  What are the three key pieces of information identifying this specific parcel within the subdivision? (Lot, Block, Subdivision Name/Phase)
3.  Where would you find the official map showing the precise boundaries, dimensions, easements, and building setback lines for this property? Be specific based on the description.
4.  **Comm/Ag Relevance:** If the description was "Lot 2, Block A, NORTH STAR INDUSTRIAL PARK..." and your client wanted to build a large warehouse immediately adjacent to the property line shown on a preliminary drawing, why is obtaining and carefully reviewing the **actual recorded plat** referenced in the description absolutely critical *before* finalizing designs or contracts? What might the plat reveal?

## Exercise 2: Metes and Bounds Description

**Excerpt:**

> "BEING a 10.00 acre tract of land situated in the John Smith Survey No. 5, Williamson County, Texas, and being more particularly described by metes and bounds as follows:
>
> BEGINNING at a 1/2 inch iron rod with cap found at the Northwest corner of the herein described tract, said point also being in the East line of County Road 101;
>
> THENCE North 89째50'10" East, along the North line of this tract, a distance of 600.00 feet to a 1/2 inch iron rod set for the Northeast corner of this tract;
>
> THENCE South 00째10'50" East, along the East line of this tract, a distance of 726.00 feet to a point in the approximate centerline of Dry Creek;
>
> THENCE Southwesterly, following the approximate centerline of Dry Creek for a distance of approximately 610 feet to a point in the East line of said County Road 101;
>
> THENCE North 00째15'00" West, along the East line of said County Road 101, a distance of 900.00 feet to the POINT OF BEGINNING and containing 10.00 acres of land, more or less."
>
> *(Disclaimer: This is a simplified example for educational purposes only and may not represent a complete or survey-accurate description.)*

**Questions:**

1.  What type of legal description method does this excerpt primarily use after the initial identification?
2.  What specific object marks the stated Point of Beginning (POB)?
3.  From the second call ("THENCE North 89째50'10" East..."), identify the "Bounds" (direction/bearing) component and the "Metes" (distance) component.
4.  The description uses the "approximate centerline of Dry Creek" as part of the boundary. What potential problems can arise over time when using natural monuments like creek centerlines in legal descriptions?
5.  **Comm/Ag Relevance:** If your client was considering purchasing a large ranch described using a lengthy, older Metes and Bounds description like this, why would you strongly recommend they obtain a **new boundary survey** from a Registered Professional Land Surveyor (RPLS) as part of their due diligence, even if the description seems complete? What issues might a new survey uncover?

## Reminder

While understanding these descriptions is crucial, always remember that precise boundary determination and interpretation require a professional survey. Written agreements in contracts regarding property descriptions are paramount. Ensure your submission addresses all questions clearly.
