# Activity 1.3: Scenario Analysis - Governmental Powers

## Objective

This activity reinforces your understanding of the governmental powers (PETE), particularly **Police Power (via Zoning)** and **Eminent Domain**, by analyzing practical scenarios.

## Instructions

1.  Read each scenario carefully based on the concepts from Lesson 1.3.
2.  Answer the specific questions asked for each scenario, explaining your reasoning.
3.  Consider the implications for property owners and the role of a real estate agent.
4.  Format your response clearly, addressing each question number.
5.  Submit your completed answers as instructed in the corresponding Asana task.

## Exercise 1: Zoning Change (Police Power)

**Scenario:**

> Your client owns a vacant parcel of land on the outskirts of a growing city, currently zoned "Agricultural (AG)". They hope to eventually sell it for commercial development. The city council is considering rezoning a large area, including your client's parcel, to "Light Industrial (LI)". Local news indicates significant debate; some nearby residents oppose the potential increase in truck traffic, while businesses favor the job creation potential.

**Questions:**

1.  Which specific governmental power (P, E, T, or E) is the city council primarily exercising by considering this rezoning?
2.  If the rezoning to Light Industrial (LI) is approved, how might this impact the *potential value* of your client's land compared to its current Agricultural zoning? Explain briefly.
3.  If the rezoning is approved, but the city also imposes strict noise limits and operating hour restrictions on future industrial uses within the LI zone, what governmental power justifies these additional restrictions?
4.  **Agent Role:** What steps might you advise your client to take *now*, during the rezoning consideration process?

## Exercise 2: Road Widening Project (Eminent Domain)

**Scenario:**

> A client owns a commercial property with a small storefront facing a busy state highway. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) announces plans to widen the highway. The preliminary plans show TxDOT needs to acquire a 15-foot-wide strip of land along the entire front of your client's property, which would eliminate their current customer parking area directly in front of the store. TxDOT has sent an initial offer letter based on an appraisal of the 15-foot strip's value.

**Questions:**

1.  What specific governmental power gives TxDOT the **right** to acquire this strip of land, assuming it's for a public purpose (highway widening)?
2.  What is the **process** called by which TxDOT will legally acquire the land if the client doesn't agree to the initial offer?
3.  Besides the value of the 15-foot strip itself, what other potential financial impacts ("damages") might the client suffer due to the taking, especially considering the loss of parking for their commercial storefront? Should "just compensation" potentially include more than just the value of the land strip taken?
4.  **Comm/Ag Relevance:** If this was agricultural land instead, and the state needed an easement through the middle of a field for a pipeline, what similar considerations regarding "damages to the remainder" might apply beyond the value of the easement strip itself? (Think about farming operations).

## Reminder

These scenarios illustrate how governmental powers directly impact real property. Understanding these concepts allows you to better advise clients and identify crucial factors during due diligence. Ensure your submission addresses all questions clearly.
