# Activity 1.1: Property Classification Scenarios

## Objective

This activity challenges you to apply the concepts from Lesson 1.1, specifically distinguishing between Real Property, Personal Property, and Fixtures. Your focus should be on utilizing the **Tests of a Fixture (MARIA)** to justify your classifications in ambiguous situations.

## Instructions

1.  Review each scenario listed below.
2.  For the **bolded item** in each scenario, determine its classification:
    *   **Real Property** (Part of the land or improvements)
    *   **Personal Property** (Chattel; movable)
    *   **Fixture** (Was personal, now legally part of the real property)
3.  Provide a concise **Justification** for your classification. For items potentially classified as Fixtures, **explicitly reference the relevant MARIA test(s)** (Method of Annexation, Adaptability, Relationship, Intention, Agreement) that support your conclusion. If an item might be a Trade Fixture, note that.
4.  Format your response clearly, for example:
    ```
    Scenario X: [Bolded Item Name]
    Classification: Fixture
    Justification: Primarily due to Method of Annexation (bolted, removal causes damage) and Adaptability (custom fit). Intention appears permanent. Agreement could override if specified in contract.
