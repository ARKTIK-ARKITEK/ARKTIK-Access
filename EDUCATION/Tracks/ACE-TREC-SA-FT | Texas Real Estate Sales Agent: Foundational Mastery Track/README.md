# ACE-TREC-SA-FT: Texas Real Estate Sales Agent: Foundational Mastery Track

Welcome to the central directory for the **ACE-TREC-SA-FT: Texas Real Estate Sales Agent: Foundational Mastery Track** within the ARKTIK Curriculum for Education (A.C.E.) framework.

## Purpose of This Track

This track provides the **180-hour qualifying education** required by the Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC) for aspiring Real Estate Sales Agents. It is meticulously designed using the **A.C.E. methodology** to ensure not only full TREC compliance but also **deep operational understanding, practical mastery, and strong ethical grounding**. Our goal is to cultivate highly competent, principled, and self-sufficient real estate professionals ready to serve their communities effectively.

## The A.C.E. Approach

Unlike traditional courses that may focus on memorization for exam passage, this track emphasizes:

*   **Mastery Through Execution:** Learning through practical application, case studies, simulations, and completing realistic tasks.
*   **Operational Understanding:** Focusing on the "why" behind regulations and connecting concepts across different areas of real estate practice.
*   **Ethical Character:** Integrating TREC's Canons of Professional Ethics and Conduct and A.C.E.'s core values throughout the curriculum.
*   **Verifiable Competency:** Demonstrating understanding through a **Portfolio of Execution** containing practical work products.

For more details on the overarching A.C.E. philosophy, please refer to the main `ace_framework_overview.md` at the root of the `/EDUCATION` directory. (Link to be adjusted based on actual repo structure).
