*   Demonstrated organizational aptitude and attention to detail.
*   Proficiency in basic computer usage and standard office software concepts (word processing, spreadsheets, email).

## Required Tools & Platforms 

Success in this foundational track requires proficiency with several standard digital tools. While ARKTIK encourages supporting businesses that offer robust tools (often via paid versions), the core competencies of this *foundational* track can typically be achieved using **freely available tiers or developer environments**.

**Essential Tools (Utilizing Free Tiers/Environments):**
*   **Asana:** Basic tier sufficient for foundational task and project tracking taught in this track.
*   **Salesforce:** Salesforce Developer Edition Org (free) sufficient for learning basic data management and navigation.
*   **QuickBooks Online:** Learning achieved via free trials, test drives, or focused simulations covering fundamental concepts and data entry workflows. (Full subscription not required *for this module*).
*   **Standard Collaboration Suite:** Google Workspace / Microsoft 365 (free or existing ARKTIK accounts for Docs, Sheets, Calendar, Mail).
*   **Communication Platforms:** Slack/Teams etc. (free tiers typically sufficient).

**ARKTIK Endorsement of Quality Tools:** While free tiers suffice for initial learning, ARKTIK recognizes the enhanced capabilities of paid versions (Asana Premium/Business, full QuickBooks Online, etc.) and encourages their adoption where appropriate in operational roles after foundational training, especially supporting vendors who align with ethical business practices or support nonprofits/startups.

**Associated A.C.E. Fees:**

*   **Tool & Platform Access Fee:** **Does NOT apply** to this foundational track, as core learning objectives can be met using freely available tool tiers or simulations.
*   **Blockchain Credential Issuance Fee:** Upon successful completion of the entire track, the standard, **universal nominal fee** applies for the issuance (minting) of your official **ARKTIK Certified Business Operations Assistant** credential onto the blockchain. This covers direct operational and transaction costs. (See Sec 7.4 of `ace_framework_overview.md`).
