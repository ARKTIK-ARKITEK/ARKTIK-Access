**Pathway:** ARKTIK Design & Development Pathway _(Or potential future Media & Communications Pathway)_
**Level:** Specialist (Phase 2/3 or 3/4)
**Cycle:** 1 / **Year:** 2025

## Track Overview

### Vision & Purpose

The **Film and Cinematography Track** is an A.C.E. program dedicated to cultivating skilled visual storytellers and technicians capable of producing high-quality, impactful video content that authentically represents ARKTIK's mission, values, and initiatives. In a world saturated with fleeting or manipulative media, this track focuses on **craftsmanship, ethical narrative construction, and technical proficiency** to create compelling documentaries, educational materials, community spotlights, and other visual communications. Participants master the filmmaking process from concept to final edit, using industry-standard tools (with a focus on **DaVinci Resolve**) and grounding their work in ARKTIK's principles. This pathway supports the **onshoring** of media production skills with a unique emphasis on purpose-driven, ethical storytelling.

### Focus Area

Core competencies include understanding narrative structure for visual media, fundamental cinematography principles (composition, lighting, camera movement), operation of DSLR/mirrorless cameras and basic audio recording equipment, proficiency in non-linear editing using DaVinci Resolve (editing, basic color correction, basic audio mixing), interview techniques, and the ethical considerations vital to documentary and representational filmmaking within the ARKTIK context.
