# ACE-ITS-101: Hardware & Operating System Fundamentals

**(Module 1 of A.C.E. Track: IT Support Technician)**

## Module Overview

### Purpose and Role

Welcome to the foundational module of the **IT Support Technician Track**. ACE-ITS-101 provides the essential bedrock upon which all other IT support skills are built. This module introduces the core physical components of computer systems and the fundamental operating systems (OS) that bring them to life. Participants will gain hands-on experience identifying, assembling, and troubleshooting basic hardware, as well as installing, configuring, and navigating common operating systems (Windows and Linux).

### Alignment with ARKTIK Values

This module emphasizes:
*   **Stewardship:** Careful handling of physical components, understanding resource usage.
*   **Precision:** Correct assembly techniques, accurate configuration settings.
*   **Integrity:** Following procedures correctly, reporting issues honestly.
*   **Resilience:** Understanding how hardware and OS work together to create functional systems.
*   **Safety:** Strict adherence to electrostatic discharge (ESD) and physical safety protocols.
*   **Foundation Building:** Mastering these basics enables effective support later.

### Duration

*   Approximately **2-3 Weeks** (Intensive, hands-on focus).

## Prerequisites

*   Successful completion of **A.C.E. Phase 0: ARKTIK Foundations & Digital Readiness**.
*   Basic familiarity with using a computer (keyboard, mouse, files).
*   Commitment to following safety procedures meticulously.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful execution and completion of this module, you will be able to:

*   Identify common internal and external computer hardware components (CPU, RAM, Motherboard, Storage, PSU, Peripherals, etc.).
*   Explain the basic function of each major hardware component.
*   Safely assemble and disassemble a standard desktop computer system following ESD precautions.
*   Identify and interpret basic BIOS/UEFI settings and POST diagnostic information.
*   Diagnose and resolve common, fundamental hardware issues (e.g., connectivity, boot problems related to core components).
*   Install both Windows (current version) and a common Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu LTS).
*   Navigate the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of both Windows and Linux effectively.
*   Execute basic file management and system information commands using the command line interface (CLI) in both Windows (CMD/PowerShell) and Linux (Bash).
*   Perform basic user account management tasks in both operating systems.
*   Explain the fundamental purpose of an operating system and file systems (NTFS, ext4 basics).

## Module Structure & Key Topics

This module integrates hardware and OS basics through hands-on practice:

1.  **Hardware Identification & Function:**
    *   Topics: Motherboards, CPUs, RAM, Storage (HDD, SSD, NVMe), Power Supplies (PSU), Expansion Cards (Graphics, Network), Cooling Systems, Cases, Peripherals (Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor), Common Ports & Connectors (USB, HDMI, Ethernet, etc.).
    *   Activity: Component identification labs (physical or virtual).
2.  **Safety & Assembly Procedures:**
    *   Topics: Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) prevention, tool usage, step-by-step PC assembly and disassembly process.
    *   Activity: Guided assembly/disassembly labs (physical or high-fidelity simulation).
3.  **System Boot Process & Basic Troubleshooting:**
    *   Topics: BIOS/UEFI purpose and navigation, boot order, Power-On Self-Test (POST), interpreting beep codes/error messages, common hardware failure symptoms.
    *   Activity: BIOS/UEFI exploration, troubleshooting simulated no-boot scenarios.
4.  **Operating System Concepts & Installation:**
    *   Topics: Purpose of an OS, comparison of Windows/Linux, installation methods (USB, DVD), partitioning basics, boot loaders (briefly).
    *   Activity: Guided installation of both Windows and Linux (potentially in Virtual Machines or on dedicated lab machines, dual-boot optional).
5.  **OS Navigation & Configuration (Windows & Linux):**
    *   Topics: Desktop environments, file explorers, control panel/settings menus, basic system configuration (display, network), user account creation/management, file system structure.
    *   Activity: Guided labs navigating both OS environments and performing standard configuration tasks.
6.  **Command Line Interface (CLI) Fundamentals:**
    *   Topics: Basic navigation (`cd`, `pwd`), listing files (`dir`/`ls`), creating/removing directories (`mkdir`, `rmdir`), copying/moving files (`copy`/`cp`, `move`/`mv`), getting system info (`ipconfig`/`ifconfig`). Introduction to administrative privileges (Run as Admin/`sudo`).
    *   Activity: CLI command execution exercises in both Windows Terminal/PowerShell and Linux Bash.

## Learning Activities & Methodology

*   **Interactive Lessons:** Covering foundational theory (`/Lessons/*.md`).
*   **Hands-On Labs:** Physical hardware assembly/disassembly (preferred where feasible), OS installations (VMs highly recommended for practice).
*   **Troubleshooting Drills:** Diagnosing intentionally faulted hardware/OS configurations.
*   **Execution Focus:** Emphasis on successfully completing procedures correctly and safely.
*   **Documentation:** Recording steps, observations, and troubleshooting outcomes. Contribution to personal Portfolio of Execution.
*   **A.C.E. 4-Phase Cycle:** Applied within lessons/labs (Foundation theory -> Applied practice -> Execution task -> Integration/Reflection).

## Execution Gate (Module Completion Criteria)

Successful completion of ACE-ITS-101 requires verified demonstration of the following:

1.  **Hardware Proficiency:** Successfully assemble a functional PC system from components (or complete equivalent simulation) following safety protocols, AND correctly identify and diagnose basic introduced hardware faults (e.g., improperly seated RAM, disconnected power/data cable).
2.  **OS Installation & Configuration:** Successfully install both Windows and a designated Linux distribution, configure basic settings (user accounts, network connectivity), and demonstrate navigation proficiency in both environments (GUI and basic CLI).
3.  **Documentation:** Complete lab reports documenting assembly steps, OS installation procedures, troubleshooting steps taken, and adherence to safety protocols.
4.  **Value Alignment:** Demonstrate consistent attention to detail (Precision), care for equipment (Stewardship), and methodical problem-solving (Integrity).

## Core Technologies Covered

PC Hardware Components (CPU, RAM, Motherboard, PSU, Storage, etc.), BIOS/UEFI Firmware, POST Diagnostics, Windows OS (Current Desktop Version), Linux OS (e.g., Ubuntu LTS Desktop), Virtualization Software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Player - for safe OS practice), Windows CMD/PowerShell (basic commands), Linux Bash Shell (basic commands), NTFS/ext4 File System Concepts.
