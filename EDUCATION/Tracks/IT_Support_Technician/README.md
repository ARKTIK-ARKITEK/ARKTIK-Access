*   **Troubleshooting Scenarios:** Diagnosing simulated hardware, software, and network faults.
*   **Role-Playing:** Practicing user support interactions.
*   **Documentation:** Using ticketing systems (simulated) and creating knowledge base articles.
*   **Portfolio Building:** Documenting completed labs and troubleshooting successes.
*   **Mentorship:** Guidance from experienced IT professionals within ARKTIK.
