# A.C.E. Track: Operations Analyst

**Pathway:** ARKTIK Business & Operational Excellence Pathway
**Level:** Practitioner / Specialist (Phase 2/3 or 3/4)
**Cycle:** 1 / **Year:** 2025

## Track Overview

### Vision & Purpose

The **Operations Analyst Track** is an A.C.E. program designed to cultivate analytical and strategic thinkers capable of **optimizing the efficiency, effectiveness, and resilience** of ARKTIK's operations and initiatives. Where the Business Operations Assistant focuses on executing processes, the Operations Analyst focuses on **analyzing, measuring, and improving** those processes through data-driven insights. This track equips members with the tools and methodologies to identify bottlenecks, reduce waste, enhance performance, and ensure operational activities remain tightly aligned with ARKTIK's mission and values. It supports the **onshoring** of analytical roles essential for continuous improvement and sustainable growth.

### Focus Area

Core competencies include Business Process Mapping and Analysis (BPMN concepts), operational data collection and rigorous analysis (advanced spreadsheet techniques, basic SQL), defining and tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Root Cause Analysis methodologies, workflow optimization techniques (Lean principles), requirements gathering for process improvements, and clear communication of analytical findings through reports and basic data visualizations.

### Target Audience

This track is ideal for ARKTIK members who:
*   Possess strong analytical, critical thinking, and quantitative reasoning skills.
