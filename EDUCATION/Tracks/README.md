# A.C.E. Track Catalog

Welcome to the central catalog for all learning **Tracks** within the **ARKTIK Curriculum for Education (A.C.E.)**. This document provides a comprehensive list of available programs designed to cultivate mastery and prepare members for execution-based contribution.

## What are A.C.E. Tracks?

A.C.E. Tracks are focused, sequential learning programs designed to build deep competency in specific, high-value skill domains aligned with ARKTIK's mission. They represent the primary guided pathways within the A.C.E. framework.

*   **Structure:** Each Track is composed of sequential **Modules**, with clear **Execution Gates** required for advancement.
*   **Focus:** Tracks combine technical skills, practical business acumen, project execution discipline, and ARKTIK's core values.
*   **Outcomes:** They are designed to prepare members for specific roles, certifications, business incubation, or apprenticeships.
*   **Levels:** Tracks range from **Foundational** (providing pathways to essential entry-level roles, often requiring only Phase 0 prerequisites) to **Practitioner** and **Specialist/Advanced** levels (requiring foundational skills and leading to deeper expertise).
