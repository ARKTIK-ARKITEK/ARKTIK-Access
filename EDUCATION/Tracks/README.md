# A.C.E. Track Catalog (Grades 6-12 Homeschool & Adult/Professional Development)

Welcome to the central catalog for learning **Tracks** within the **ARKTIK Curriculum for Education (A.C.E.)**. These programs serve **both homeschool students (Grades 6-12) and adult learners/professionals**, offering pathways to mastery through disciplined execution. Tracks are designed primarily to equip individuals with **high-value, execution-proven skills for domestic US careers and entrepreneurship**, strengthening local economies and supporting the **onshoring** of vital professions, while also cultivating talent deeply aligned with ARKTIK's mission and values.

## What are A.C.E. Tracks?

A.C.E. Tracks are curated **sequences of intensive, one-month A.C.E. Skill Intensives** (practical, deliverable-focused courses) typically integrated within a specific **ARKTIK Pathway**. They guide learners progressively towards deep competency in specialized domains relevant to **today's job market** and **ARKTIK's strategic initiatives**, demanding rigorous application and demonstrated mastery.

*   **Structure:** Each Track outlines a recommended sequence of monthly Skill Intensives. For K-12 participants, these run concurrently with daily Core Curriculum studies. Adult learners typically focus on the Skill Intensive sequence, with Core Curriculum prerequisites potentially validated via prior learning (RPL).
*   **Levels:** Courses within Tracks progress from **Foundational** (suitable for middle school or adult entry-level) through **Practitioner** (high school / intermediate adult) to **Specialist/Advanced** levels (late high school / advanced adult / professional). Some courses/tracks may carry a **(GT)** designation for enriched/accelerated content.
*   **Outcomes:** Tracks prepare participants for higher education, specific career roles (prioritizing onshoring), certifications, entrepreneurship, or contribution within ARKTIK ('first fruits').
