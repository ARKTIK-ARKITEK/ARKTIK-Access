# ARKTIK Manual Review Process  

## **Introduction**  
The **ARKTIK Manual Review Process** ensures that all governance decisions, membership verifications, ranking advancements, and execution-based rewards are subject to a structured, transparent, and accountable review system.  

While smart contracts automate most verifications, **manual review is required for high-stakes governance, appeals, and exceptional cases.**
