# ARKTIK Multi-Signature Verification Framework  

## **Introduction**  
The **ARKTIK Multi-Signature Verification Framework** ensures that all high-level governance decisions, financial transactions, and credentialing processes require multiple authorized approvals, reinforcing security, integrity, and decentralized accountability.  

Multi-signature verification prevents unauthorized actions and ensures that ARKTIK governance remains transparent, faith-driven, and execution-based.
