# ARKTIK Execution-Based Ranking System  

## **Introduction**  
The **ARKTIK Execution-Based Ranking System** establishes a structured pathway for members to advance within ARKTIK’s economic, educational, and operational ecosystem.  

Unlike traditional ranking models based on passive participation, ARKTIK’s ranking is determined by **execution, mastery, and contribution to real-world projects**.
