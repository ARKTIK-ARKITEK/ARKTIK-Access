# ARKTIK Financial Stewardship Framework  

## **Introduction**  
The **ARKTIK Financial Stewardship Framework** ensures that all economic activity within ARKTIK aligns with **faith-driven accountability, execution-based value creation, and responsible resource management.**  

Stewardship is not just about managing wealth—it is about **ensuring that resources are used ethically, reinvested wisely, and distributed based on measurable impact.**

## **1. Principles of Financial Stewardship**  

- **Wealth is a responsibility, not an entitlement.**  
- **All financial growth must be tied to execution, governance participation, and real-world impact.**  
- **Speculation, passive accumulation, and financial mismanagement are not tolerated.**  
- **Resources must be reinvested into faith-driven initiatives, education, and sustainable community growth.**
