# ARKTIK Member Onboarding Guide  

## **Introduction**  
The **ARKTIK Membership Onboarding Process** is designed to ensure that all members align with ARKTIK’s **execution-first philosophy, faith-driven governance, and blockchain-based verification system.**  

Membership is **not passive**—it requires active participation, execution-based contributions, and adherence to the highest ethical and operational standards.

### **1.2 Required Onboarding Steps**  
1️⃣ **Application Submission** – Prospective members complete a structured application verifying alignment with ARKTIK values.

3️⃣ **Smart Contract-Based Agreement** – Members sign a **blockchain-verified membership contract** ensuring compliance with ARKTIK governance and execution standards.  
4️⃣ **Community Integration & Training** – Members are onboarded through structured courses, mentorship programs, and real-world execution pathways.

## **2. Blockchain-Based Membership Verification**  

Each ARKTIK member is assigned a **unique blockchain credential**, ensuring:  

✅ **Immutable identity & verification of execution-based achievements.**  
✅ **Smart contract enforcement of governance, participation, and ethical compliance.**  
✅ **Tokenized rewards for contributions, projects, and mentorship efforts.**  

### **2.1 Membership Access & Security**  
- **All onboarding documents, agreements, and certifications are stored on a blockchain ledger.**  
- **Member access is tied to execution milestones—passive membership is not allowed.**  
- **Exit & revocation policies ensure only active, aligned participants remain within ARKTIK.**

## **3. Execution-Based Member Contributions**  

Every ARKTIK member is expected to **contribute through execution, not just participation.** Contribution pathways include:  

✅ **Project Execution** – Leading or contributing to an ARKTIK-approved initiative.

✅ **Business Development** – Launching or integrating businesses into the ARKTIK ecosystem.

**Failure to execute results in reduced privileges, restricted access, or membership revocation.**

## **4. Web3 Credentialing & Tokenized Incentives**  

All membership activity is tracked via Web3 technology, ensuring:  

✅ **Credentialing via smart contracts for verified execution milestones.**  
✅ **Tokenized incentives for high-value contributions & ecosystem growth.**
