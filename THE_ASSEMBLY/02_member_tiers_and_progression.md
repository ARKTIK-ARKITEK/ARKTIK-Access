# THE ASSEMBLY  
## 02 — Member Tiers & Progression

> “By their fruit you will recognize them.” — Matthew 7:16  
> **We do not elevate. We observe.**

---

### 1. **The Visitor**  
> *Drawn by the light. Resting. Reasoning.*

- Quietly observing, often weary of religion or trend-based systems  
- Seeking stillness, safety, or truth—but not yet ready to move  
- Welcome without pressure, questions, or requirements  
- Presence is enough. Peace is the offering.

**They are not on the outside. They are at the threshold.**  

---

### 2. **The Returned**  
> *No longer lost. No longer running.*

- Has chosen alignment over applause  
- Begins rebuilding personal rhythm—prayer, priorities, purity  
- Speaks less. Listens more.  
- Ready for order, even if they don’t yet have all the tools

**They’ve stopped performing. They’re ready to be rebuilt.**

---

### 3. **The Steward**  
> *From tending the self to governing the space around them.*

- Actively walking in discipline: home, health, habits, time, tongue  
- No longer shaped by culture—now shaping their culture  
- Doesn’t announce growth—*they embody it*  
- Becomes a source of calm, structure, and quiet strength

**They are proof that sanctification is strategy.**

---

### 4. **The Extender**  
> *Multiplying what was restored.*

- Lives in rhythm, not reaction  
- Builds without striving, invites without forcing  
- Covers others without advertising it  
- They don’t carry microphones. They carry tables.

**They are the fruitbearers—branches from the True Vine.**

---

### Final Notes

- There is **no pressure to ascend**—only to remain aligned  
- Growth is **observed**, not announced  
- Movement is **organic, quiet, and sealed by THE ONE**

---

> If no one claps but THE ONE smiles—  
> you’re growing.
