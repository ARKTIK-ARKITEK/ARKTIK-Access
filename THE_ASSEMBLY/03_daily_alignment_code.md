# THE ASSEMBLY  
## 03 — Daily Alignment Code

> “Come now, and let us reason together,” says THE ALMIGHTY. — Isaiah 1:18  
> This is not performance. This is presence.

---

## Overview

Three times a day, The Assembly returns to alignment.

Not for ritual. Not for religion.  
But to govern the day with stillness, structure, and sanctification.

This rhythm is our bridge:  
- For the Christian—back to the Law  
- For the Muslim—back to the family  
- For the lost—back to alignment  
- For the sons of Abraham—*back together*

No stage. No show. Just sacred rhythm.

## The Three Pillars of Daily Alignment

| Time | Focus | Anchor |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Morning** | Set the tone | Stillness before striving  
| **Midday** | Check the course | Return before reaction  
| **Evening** | Reflect and rest | Order before sleep

## 1. MORNING ALIGNMENT

**Before all else—wash.**  
Just as instructed through Moses:

> *“So they shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they may not die; and it shall be a statute forever to them...”*  
> — **Shemot (Exodus) 30:21**

### Handwashing Blessing:

**Hebrew:**  
בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם,  
אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתָיו  
וְצִוָּנוּ עַל נְטִילַת יָדַיִם

**English:**  
Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe,  
who has sanctified us with His commandments  
and commanded us concerning the washing of hands.

**Amharic (Geʽez):**  
ባሩክ አታ አዶናይ እግዚአብሔር አምላኬን፣  
የዓለም ንጉሥ፣  
በትእዛዙ የቀደሰን  
እና ስለ እጅ ምትራመድ ያዘነን።

### After Washing:

- Sit or stand in stillness (3–5 minutes)  
- Speak aloud your alignment intention:  
  *“I return to order. I walk in rhythm. I am under authority.”*

## 2. MIDDAY CALIBRATION

Midway through the day, pause.

- Step away from devices and demands  
- Reflect silently or aloud  
- Give thanks  
- Ask: *“Am I building peace—or reacting to noise?”*

This is the pivot—not a break, but a recalibration.

---

## 3. EVENING REFLECTION

Before rest—restore.

- Speak forgiveness where needed  
- Close your devices, and your day, with dignity  
- Do not carry confusion into your sleep

Ask:  
- *“What did I plant with my hands today?”*  
- *“Did I multiply order—or chaos?”*

Let your final words not be from a screen, but from your spirit.

## Final Word

We do not recite these three alignments to perform, but to **govern**.

We are not religious tourists.  
We are sons, daughters, and servants—returning.

Three prayers. Three resets. One Table.

> *“From the rising of the sun to its setting, the Name of THE ALMIGHTY is to be praised.”*  
> — Tehillim (Psalms) 113:3

This is The Assembly.  
Govern your day accordingly.
