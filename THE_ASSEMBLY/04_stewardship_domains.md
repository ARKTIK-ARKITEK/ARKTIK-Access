## Overview

The Assembly does not honor public performance.  
We observe private stewardship.

Your walk is not measured by how you appear in crowds, but by what you govern in silence.

There are five primary domains of stewardship.  
In each one, alignment is not perfection—it is attention, intention, and discipline.

---

## 1. TIME

> “So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.” — Tehillim (Psalms) 90:12

- Do you rule your time, or does time rule you?  
- Do your hours reflect eternity or urgency?  
- What moments are being stolen by distraction, obligation, or entertainment?

**Stewardship Practice:**  
- Set your morning, midday, and evening alignment anchors  
- Limit idle scrolling, passive entertainment, or reaction-based scheduling  
- Treat your time like seed—it will grow what you allow

## 2. SPEECH

> “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.” — Mishlei (Proverbs) 18:21

- Are your words measured or multiplied?  
- Are you correcting or controlling with speech?  
- Is your voice building faith or fueling confusion?

**Stewardship Practice:**  
- Speak less, but with weight  
- Do not lie to appear peaceful, nor rage to appear bold  
- Let your yes be yes—your no be no

## 3. HOME

> “As for me and my house, we will serve THE ALMIGHTY.” — Yehoshua (Joshua) 24:15

- Does your space carry order or chaos?  
- Are the unseen corners of your home sacred or sloppy?  
- Do your family, roommates, or guests experience peace—or performance?

**Stewardship Practice:**  
- Keep the home clean without idolatry of image  
- Let meals be covered in thanks—not just content  
- Speak truth at the table. No masks. No characters.

## 4. LAND / WORK

> “You shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands; you shall be blessed, and it shall be well with you.” — Tehillim (Psalms) 128:2

- Are you working with excellence—or exhaustion?  
- Is your labor aligned with your faith?  
- Do your hands build what lasts, or repeat what fails?

**Stewardship Practice:**  
- Work clean, not desperate  
- Let every field, floor, farm, or file you touch be marked by order  
- Take breaks that restore, not distract

---

## 5. CONNECTION

> “How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity.” — Tehillim (Psalms) 133:1

- Do your relationships serve truth—or convenience?  
- Are you yoked to clarity or confusion?  
- Have you reconciled with what you ran from?

**Stewardship Practice:**  
- Keep short accounts. Do not store bitterness.  
- Let silence be holy—not a weapon  
- Restore where you can. Release what you must.

## Final Word

Stewardship is the evidence of alignment.  
It is the garden you were assigned to guard.

No audience.  
No spotlight.  
Just discipline—seen by THE ONE, tested by time.

Govern your domains accordingly.  
Let your stewardship speak louder than your statements.
