# THE ASSEMBLY  
## 05 — The Language of The Assembly

> “Let your words be few.” — Kohelet (Ecclesiastes) 5:2  
> We do not waste words. We **govern** them.

## Overview

Language is culture.  
Speech is atmosphere.  
What we say shapes what we build.

The Assembly does not mimic the language of the world.  
We speak with discipline, clarity, and weight.

Our words are not polished to perform, nor sloppy to appear “authentic.”  
We speak as those who are accountable for every utterance.

---

## 1. We Speak with Intention

- No empty hype  
- No vague affirmations  
- No self-deprecation masked as humility

We do not say things “just to say them.”  
We speak when words are required—and rest when they are not.

---

## 2. We Use Clean, Clear Language

- No slang, street terms, or trend-based expressions  
- No clickbait, emojis, or phrases borrowed from secular culture  
- No passive-aggressive joking, sarcasm, or suggestive tones

**We are not stiff. We are sacred.**

Let our words bring light, not laughter at another’s expense.

---

## 3. We Do Not Speak Against the Work

- No slandering our own alignment journey  
- No minimizing the weight of what we are building  
- No calling holy things “crazy,” “intense,” or “too much”

Let what is sacred remain sacred—even in casual conversation.

---

## 4. We Do Not Lie for Peace

- No false apologies  
- No forced agreeability  
- No performative “love” language to avoid confrontation

Truth is peace.  
Truth spoken in love is our culture.

## 5. Words We Use

To maintain clarity and unity, here are terms we use intentionally:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **THE ONE** | The Eternal Creator of all things. No substitutes.  
| **Alignment** | Returning to the original order and design  
| **Govern** | To take responsibility, not control  
| **Stewardship** | The act of managing what has been entrusted by THE ONE  
| **Return** | Coming out of confusion or counterfeit into truth  
| **Refinement** | The process of sanctification and maturity—not punishment  
| **The Table** | The place of unity, belonging, and sacred invitation

## Final Word

We do not speak like the crowd.  
We do not brand our brokenness.  
We do not bend our language to fit the times.

We speak with weight, rhythm, and honor.

Let your words prove that you’ve **returned**.
