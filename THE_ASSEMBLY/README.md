# THE ASSEMBLY

**A Sanctuary for the Canceled, the Silenced, and the Searching**

> “Come now, and let us reason together,” says THE ALMIGHTY. — Isaiah 1:18

## Welcome Home

If you've ever been:

- Cast out for telling the truth,
- Silenced for seeking clarity,
- Misunderstood for rejecting counterfeit systems—

**You have a seat at this table.**

THE ASSEMBLY is neither a movement nor a reactionary collective. It is a carefully structured restoration of divine order, authentic identity, and spiritual alignment under **THE ONE**.

---

## Clear Statement of Alignment and Standards

**THE ASSEMBLY** operates strictly according to the explicit teachings and commands outlined by GOD in the Scriptures. Our commitment to transparency requires clarity regarding our partnerships and affiliations:

- **No partnerships or affiliations** with any organizations or entities whose activities, missions, or values conflict with the explicit and historical positions outlined by GOD in Scripture.
- **Uncompromising adherence** to biblical teachings that affirm GOD’s unchanging nature (Malachi 3:6) and unwavering truthfulness (Numbers 23:19).
- Recognition of historical judgments, such as the destruction of Sodom (Genesis 19:24-25), as foundational examples underscoring GOD’s explicit stance against certain practices.

While our platform is respectful, welcoming, and family-friendly, we do not accommodate, support, or endorse practices or organizations explicitly condemned by Scripture—regardless of cultural popularity or nuanced interpretation.

This transparency ensures our community maintains alignment with THE ONE, promoting clarity, peace, and spiritual integrity, thereby preventing confusion that could lead to conflict.
