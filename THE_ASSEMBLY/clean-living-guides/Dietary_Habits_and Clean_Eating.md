## Why Food Is Sacred

Your body is not a machine.  
It is a **dwelling place**, a vessel, a creation in covenant.  
What you put inside it should reflect **intention, alignment, and holiness.**

## Scriptural Foundations

### Leviticus 11:2  
> “These are the living creatures which you may eat among all the animals…”

### Deuteronomy 14:3–21  
> A complete guide to clean and unclean animals

### Daniel 1:8  
> “But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the king’s food…”

- Avoid blood, shellfish, pork, and mixtures prohibited by THE ONE  
- Keep a distinction between clean and unclean in **meats, cookware, and preparation**  
- Minimize processed and chemically-altered foods

## Clean Eating in Spirit

- Eat to **strengthen**, not to indulge  
- Ask: Is this food helping me serve THE ONE better?  
- Practice **gratitude before eating** and **moderation while eating**

---

## Practical Tips
