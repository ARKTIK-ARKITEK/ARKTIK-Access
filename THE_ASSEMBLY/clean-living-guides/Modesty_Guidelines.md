## Modesty is More Than Fabric

Modesty is not simply about what is covered—  
It is about **what is revealed in spirit, posture, and intent.**

Modesty in THE ASSEMBLY is a return to:
- **Order over attention**
- **Presence over performance**
- **Honor over seduction**

## Scriptural Foundations

### Exodus 28:42  
> “Make linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh... from the hips to the thighs.”

### Micah 6:8  
> “What does the LORD require of you? To act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.”

### Isaiah 3:16–24 (paraphrased)  
> A warning against excessive adornment and seductive walking

---

## Practical Guidelines (Not Rules)

- Clothing should **not expose** thighs, chest, midsection, or undergarments  
- Skirts and garments should allow for sitting, bending, and movement without revealing  
- Avoid materials that are sheer, form-clinging, or designed to provoke  
- Men and women should both walk with **covered dignity**

---

## Modesty in Speech and Posture

- Speak calmly, don’t dominate with volume  
- Stand upright, avoid slouching or swaying to draw attention  
- Walk as one aware of who they represent: THE ONE

---

## Children's Modesty

- Teach children modesty by example  
- Their clothing and behavior are sacred—not performance tools  
- Let their innocence be **shielded**, not exposed

---

## Final Reflection

> “Modesty is the frame. The soul is the art.”  
> Your body is sacred space. Treat it like a sanctuary.
