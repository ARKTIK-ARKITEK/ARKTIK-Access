## Why It Matters

Music and media are not neutral.  
They are spiritual technologies that either:

- **Soften or harden** the heart  
- **Uplift or unravel** the mind  
- **Honor or oppose** THE ONE

---

## Scriptural Anchors

### Proverbs 4:23  
> “Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.”

### Psalm 101:3  
> “I will set no worthless thing before my eyes...”

### Amos 5:23  
> “Take away from Me the noise of your songs...”

## Guidelines for Music

- Avoid songs that **glorify lust, violence, pride, rebellion, or false gods**  
- Prioritize music that **centers peace, truth, and purity**  
- Evaluate **spirit first, lyrics second, beat last**  
- Instrumental music can also carry spiritual residue—be discerning

---

## Guidelines for Media

- Do not normalize wickedness through entertainment  
- Remove shows/movies with mocking of THE ONE, perversion, or spirit of confusion  
- Reduce dependency on screens to stimulate mood  
- Invite THE ONE into what you allow before your eyes and ears

---

## Questions to Ask

- Would I play this in a room where THE ONE is visibly present?  
- What does this feed in me: lust or love? fear or faith? rebellion or reverence?

---

## Spoken Declaration

> “I will no longer entertain what I would not entertain if THE ONE sat beside me.”
