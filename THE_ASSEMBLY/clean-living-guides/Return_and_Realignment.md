## Why This Page Exists

This is for the one who strayed, wandered, or didn’t know.  
It’s not a rebuke. It’s a map back to wholeness.  
You are not condemned—you are being called.

## The Heart of Realignment

- You are not too far gone  
- You are not too broken  
- You are not too late

Everything begins again with **one intentional return**.

---

## Steps to Begin the Return

1. **Pause** — Acknowledge the path you’ve been on  
2. **Repent** — Not just regret, but a change in direction  
3. **Rebuild** — Small daily acts of discipline  
4. **Reconnect** — With THE ONE, with His order, and with your purpose

## Speak This Aloud

> “THE ONE who created me still calls me.  
> I return—not with shame, but with sincerity.  
> I no longer define myself by my fall, but by my return.”

---

## Pillar of THE ASSEMBLY

> **“Truth without harshness, and gentleness without compromise.”**  
Let this be the measure of your tone, your return, your leadership, and your walk.

---

## Final Encouragement

This walk is not about perfection.  
It’s about direction.

You’re not alone.  
You’re being welcomed—step by step—home.
