# Social Conduct and Behavior  
**“You Represent More Than Yourself”**  
*THE ASSEMBLY | Clean Living Series*  
*Language, Law & Legacy Division — Issac Directory*

## Why It Matters

You are not just a person—you are a carrier of the Name.  
How you **walk, speak, interact, and respond** either draws people toward THE ONE or pushes them away.

---

## Scriptural Foundations

### Leviticus 19:18  
> “Love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.”

### Proverbs 15:1  
> “A soft answer turns away wrath…”

### Ecclesiastes 5:2  
> “Let your words be few…”

## Conduct in Public and Private

- Walk with **dignity and calm**, not with hurried pride  
- Let your “yes” be yes, and your “no” be no—clear, respectful communication  
- Practice **truth without harshness**, and **gentleness without compromise**

---

## Social Media and Online Behavior

- Never post what you wouldn’t say in a sanctuary  
- Don’t use platforms to argue, shame, or posture  
- Speak light—or remain silent

---

## Table Conduct

- Don’t interrupt, don’t compete to speak  
- Chew with quietness; give thanks before and after meals  
- Speak words of life, not gossip or bitterness

---

## Accountability Within THE ASSEMBLY

- Hold each other with gentleness and firmness  
- Never rebuke publicly what could be corrected privately  
- Let behavior reflect: **“We are of THE ONE”**

---

## Final Reminder

> “The world will know us not just by what we believe,  
> but by **how we behave**.”
