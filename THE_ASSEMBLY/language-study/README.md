**Restoring Speech. Reclaiming Sound. Remembering Who We Are.**

---

## “For then I will restore to the peoples a pure language,  
That they all may call on the name of THE ALMIGHTY,  
To serve Him with one accord.”  
— Zephaniah 3:9

## Why Language Matters

We were never meant to pray in confusion, study in translation, or speak without understanding.

**Language is not just communication—it’s alignment.**  
To restore the covenant, we return to the sound.

This is not about fluency.  
This is about faithfulness.

## Where to Begin

**Start with your sound.**  
Choose one of the sacred languages: Hebrew, Amharic, or Aramaic.

Then:

1. Learn the **letters**  
2. Learn the **meaning** behind those letters  
3. Learn the **phrases** we speak during alignment, washing, blessing, and prayer  
4. Practice daily—not to perform, but to remember

## Our Approach

- **No pressure for fluency**  
- **No comparison to others**  
- **No academic spirit**

We don’t teach for speed.  
We teach for memory. For meaning. For return.

## Final Word

This is not a language course.  
It is the restoration of sound.

If you don’t know where to start—**start with the blessing you say when you wash**.  
If you’ve never studied before—**you’re in the right place**.

You are not behind.  
You are home.

Welcome to The Assembly.
