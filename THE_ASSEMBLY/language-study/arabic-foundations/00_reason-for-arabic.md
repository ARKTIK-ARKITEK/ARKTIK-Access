# Why We Study Arabic  
**Before You Read Further—Understand the Reason**

---

## This is not a political move.  
This is not a token of inclusion.  
This is not compromise.

---

## This is reconciliation. This is restoration.

We do not study Arabic to become something else.  
We study Arabic because it is the **tongue of our brothers**—  
The children of Abraham through Ishmael.

For centuries, the divide between Isaac and Ishmael has been deepened by war, pride, and silence.  
But THE ONE did not forget either line.  
And neither will we.

---

## Why Arabic?

- Because millions speak it—and have never heard the Torah in their own tongue  
- Because many have been lied to about what Scripture says  
- Because reconciliation requires **understanding**, not assumption  
- Because THE ASSEMBLY is not tribal—we are **rooted in truth**

---

## Who This Is For

- Those raised in Christian or Jewish circles who never learned Arabic  
- Those who want to read and understand—not react  
- Those who seek peace through accountability and alignment  
- Sons of Abraham who know the time has come to reason together

---

## What This Is Not

- This is **not Islamic doctrine**  
- This is **not Arabic culture class**  
- This is **not about conversion**

This is about **honoring the language** spoken by billions,  
while staying grounded in the Eternal Covenant.

---

## Final Word

We do not add Arabic to look inclusive.  
We study it to **repair the breach**.

If Hebrew is our root,  
If Greek is our bridge,  
Then Arabic is our reconciliation.

**Welcome to the return.**

— THE ASSEMBLY
