**Reconciliation. Revelation. Return.**

## “And We made them leaders, guiding by Our command. And We inspired them to do good deeds, establish prayer, and give zakat, and they were worshipers of Us alone.”  
— Surah Al-Anbiya (21:73)

## If you’ve read the reason—then you understand the rhythm.

We do not teach Arabic to blend in.  
We teach Arabic because it is the language of **Ishmael’s descendants**,  
and one of the most widely spoken tongues in the world.

We speak not to agree with everything taught in it,  
but to reach those who would never hear unless we honored it.

## Our Approach

- **Respect without compromise**  
- **Reverence without confusion**  
- **Reconciliation without dilution**

We teach Arabic to know, not to submit.  
We study so we can reason—**not react**.

## Final Word

You cannot claim to walk in covenant  
if you refuse to speak the language of your brother.

Arabic is not foreign to THE ASSEMBLY.  
It is family—returning home.

**Welcome to the reconciliation.**

— THE ASSEMBLY
