**“Why Enoch? Why Now?”**  
*THE ASSEMBLY | Language, Law & Legacy Division*

## Purpose  
This foundational file introduces the **Book of Enoch (መጽሐፈ ሄኖክ | Mets’hafe Henok)** as a sacred and preserved work found only in the Ge’ez tradition. This primer is not designed to speculate or sensationalize, but to **restore** what was once known among the prophets, early believers, and scribal traditions.

## Who Was Enoch?

- **Hebrew:** חֲנוֹךְ (Ḥanokh)  
- **Ge’ez:** ሄኖክ (Henok)  
- **Meaning:** *Dedicated* or *Initiated*

Enoch walked with THE ONE and was taken without seeing death. (Genesis 5:24)  
His writings describe a world **before the flood**, when spiritual beings interfered with creation.

---

## Why It Was Removed  
The Book of Enoch was:
- Revered by early Christians and quoted in the Epistle of Jude.
- Removed by later councils for reasons tied to **angelology, judgment, and esoteric knowledge**.
- Preserved only in **Ge’ez** through the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

---

## What Makes It Important?

- **Names the Watchers** who defied THE ONE’s command.
- Describes **judgment**, **astral law**, and **time itself** as sacred.
- Prophesies about the **Elect One** (a Messianic figure) with imagery tied to Daniel and Revelation.
- Provides insight into the **pre-flood world** and the fall of hidden knowledge.

We approach Enoch not as entertainment, but as **restored witness testimony**.
