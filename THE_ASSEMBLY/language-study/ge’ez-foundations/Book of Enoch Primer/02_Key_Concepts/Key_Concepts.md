## Objective  
To understand the core sacred concepts presented in the Book of Enoch—not as fantasy, but as **legal testimony**, **cosmic memory**, and **prophetic witness**.

These are not symbolic phrases. These are **functions in the Divine Order**.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Watchers (መላእክት እንበር)
Heavenly beings tasked with observing.  
Some of them **descended**, broke rank, and **revealed knowledge** that fractured the earth’s obedience.

> “They taught sorcery, enchantments, the cutting of roots, and astrology.” — Enoch 7:1

---

### 2. The Nephilim (ነፍሊም)
The unnatural offspring of the Watchers and human women.  
They brought chaos, devoured mankind, and introduced bloodshed.

---

### 3. Judgment (ፍርድ)
A divine reckoning declared through Henok.  
Judgment in Enoch is not metaphor—it is procedural, recorded in the **Heavenly Tablets**.

---

### 4. The Elect One (የተመረጠው)
Appears in visions as the **Son of Man**, the **Righteous Judge**, and the **Anointed of THE ONE**.  
He stands above the stars, is hidden for a time, and will **bring justice in the latter days**.

---

### 5. The Heavenly Tablets (ጽሑፋት ሰማያዊ)
Divine scrolls or books that record:
- The deeds of angels and men
- The timing of seasons
- The path of judgment
They are shown to Henok and referenced across multiple chapters.

---

### 6. Astral Law (ሕጉ ከዋክብት)
Enoch outlines the obedience of the **sun, moon, and stars**.  
Their cycles are part of divine testimony.  
To break the order of time is to wage rebellion against THE ONE.

---

### 7. The Tree of Life
Enoch sees paradise, a tree unlike any on earth, reserved for the **righteous and elect**.  
This echoes Eden, Revelation, and the reward of the faithful.

---

### 8. Time as Testimony
In Enoch, **time is sacred**.  
The misalignment of calendars, festivals, and holy seasons is a form of rebellion.  
True obedience is marked by returning to THE ONE’s timekeeping.
