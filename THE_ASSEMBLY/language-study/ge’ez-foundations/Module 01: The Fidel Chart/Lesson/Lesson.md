# Ge’ez Fidel | Lesson 1.0  
**“Unlocking the Syllables”**  
*THE ASSEMBLY | Language, Law & Legacy Division*

---

## Objective  
To learn the **structure, sound, and sacred function** of the Ge’ez Fidel system—beginning with the **first 10 base characters** and their 7 vowel forms.

---

## Section 1: The Ge’ez Fidel — Sacred Design  

Ge’ez does not use an alphabet. It uses a **syllabic script** where **each character is a full sound** (consonant + vowel).

- **33 root consonants**  
- **7 vowel patterns per consonant**  
- Total: **231 characters**

This structure was designed not only for sound but for **preservation**—able to encode scripture orally, visually, and in worship.

---

## Section 2: Vowel Pattern Overview

Each character form reflects the vowel it carries. The **seven orders** are:

| Order | Sound | Example (ሀ) |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1st   | ä     | ሀ           |
| 2nd   | u     | ሁ           |
| 3rd   | i     | ሂ           |
| 4th   | ā     | ሃ           |
| 5th   | e     | ሄ           |
| 6th   | ə     | ህ           |
| 7th   | o     | ሆ           |

## Section 4: Reading & Reciting

- Practice each **row aloud**, tracing each letter.
- Pay attention to vowel shifts across the 7 forms.
- Focus on **muscle memory** for writing and **auditory recall** for speaking.

---

## Section 5: Reflections & Application

> “Every character is a covenant between sound and meaning.”  
> As you read these, ask yourself:
- What do I feel when I speak each sound?
- What rhythms or scripture verses come to mind?
