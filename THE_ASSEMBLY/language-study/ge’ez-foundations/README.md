# Ge’ez Language Track | THE ASSEMBLY  
*Preservation, Honor, and Prophetic Study*

## Overview

The Ge’ez section of THE ASSEMBLY is not simply a linguistic study.  
It is a **spiritual restoration**—an honoring of the ancient language that preserved the **Book of Enoch (መጽሐፈ ሄኖክ)**, the Psalms, and the earliest Christian scriptures in their most original forms.

## Mission

- Structured language lessons
- Liturgical and scripture-based vocabulary
- Historical and theological context
- Special integration of the Book of Enoch
