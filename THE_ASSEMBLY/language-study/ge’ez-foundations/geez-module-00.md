# Ge’ez Module 00  
**“Before the Letters”**  
*THE ASSEMBLY | Language, Law & Legacy Division*

---

## Purpose of This Module
Ge’ez is not just a language.  
It is the **keeper of scrolls** unseen by most of the world.  
Before you learn the script, you must learn the **weight**.

This module prepares your mind, spirit, and tongue to **honor Ge’ez**—not as an academic curiosity, but as a **sacred access point** into prophecy, preservation, and priesthood.

## Spiritual Posture Before Study

Before approaching Ge’ez, prepare yourself with:

1. **Clean Hands & Feet** – Acknowledging you are stepping onto sacred ground.
2. **Intention Declaration**  
   > “I do not come to claim. I come to honor, to preserve, and to understand what THE ONE preserved through the hands of the faithful.”
3. **Silence (1 Minute)** – Allow the mind to settle. No study of Ge’ez begins in noise.
4. **Blessing the Tongue**  
   > “May my tongue speak only what is worthy. May it never profane what was carried through fire.”

## Why This Matters

Ge’ez is the last guardrail before the world begins to reinterpret what it never inherited.  
It is a gatekeeper language—**not for ownership, but for stewardship**.

THE ASSEMBLY recognizes the risk of turning languages into vanity tools. Ge’ez will never be taught here without the **Book of Enoch**, **Hebraic context**, and **proper conduct**.

## Your Commitment

If you wish to continue, declare silently or aloud:

> “I approach with honor. I am not the first. I will not be the last. I will never twist what was given. I will protect the scrolls.”
