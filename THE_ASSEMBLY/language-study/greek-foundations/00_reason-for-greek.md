# Why We Study Greek  
**Before You Read Further—Understand the Reason**

---

## This is not for style.  
This is not to “unlock secrets.”  
This is not to appear deep.

---

## This is about accountability.

If you are going to speak about faith—  
You must study the faith you claim to defend.

That does not mean repeating sermons.  
That does not mean quoting TikToks.  
That does not mean reciting verses without knowing where they come from.

It means returning to the **original form**,  
before commentary,  
before confusion,  
before corruption.

## Why Greek?

Because many have built entire doctrines on words they cannot define.  
Because countless souls were led astray by misquoted or misunderstood Greek texts.  
Because the world was given a Greek translation—and THE ASSEMBLY must know what it actually says.

This is not about mastering Greek.  
It is about mastering your mouth.

---

## You are accountable for what you teach.  
You are accountable for what you repeat.  
You are accountable for how you represent THE ONE.

So we study—not to perform,  
but to **present ourselves as stewards of the Word**, rightly dividing it.

---

## Final Note

Do not continue until you understand this:

We don’t teach Greek to elevate ourselves.  
We teach it so that we are **no longer careless** with the most sacred truths ever spoken.

This is how we return to alignment.

— THE ASSEMBLY
