**Accountability. Alignment. Accuracy.**

## If you’ve read the reason—then you’re ready for the rhythm.

This is not a language course.  
This is a path to **honest discussion** and Orthodox-rooted clarity.

We study Greek in THE ASSEMBLY because:

- The New Testament was recorded in Greek  
- Many modern doctrines rise and fall on Greek words  
- Entire lives have been shaped by misquotes, mistranslations, and misused phrases

We do not speak without study.  
We do not teach what we’ve never searched.  
We do not repeat what we cannot trace.

## Our Approach

- **We trace, not race.**  
- **We restore meaning, not mimic culture.**  
- **We teach from clarity, not pride.**

This Greek section honors **Orthodox foundations only**.  
No Roman Catholic or Latinized content is allowed.  
This is nonnegotiable.

## Final Word

Greek does not replace Hebrew.  
But it can restore clarity when studied in truth.

If you're going to speak on scripture,  
you must study the language it was first preserved in.

**Welcome to the discipline of sound.**
