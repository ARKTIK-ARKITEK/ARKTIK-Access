**Greek Terms Commonly Mistranslated in Modern Doctrine**  
*(Orthodox-Aligned • No Latin Influence)*

> “Rightly dividing the word of truth...” — 2 Timothy 2:15

These are not just mistranslations. They are doctrinal fractures.  
Below are Greek words that have been altered, simplified, or mistranslated—intentionally or carelessly—over time.

## 1. ἐκκλησία (*ekklesia*)

- **True Meaning:** Assembly, called-out ones  
- **False Translation:** “Church” (institution or building)  
- **Clarification:** *Ekklesia* refers to people gathered for a purpose, often for alignment with YHWH—not a denomination, not a structure.

---

## 2. νόμος (*nomos*)

- **True Meaning:** Law, instruction, divine order  
- **False Translation:** “Legalism” or “burden”  
- **Clarification:** Used throughout scripture to mean **Torah**—a structure of life and freedom. Modern usage wrongly casts it as obsolete.

## 3. χάρις (*charis*)

- **True Meaning:** Grace, favor, divine enablement  
- **False Translation:** “Permission to sin” or “unmerited license”  
- **Clarification:** *Charis* in its Koine context was always tied to **empowerment**, not exemption from obedience.

## 4. μετάνοια (*metanoia*)

- **True Meaning:** Change of mind, turn of direction  
- **False Translation:** “Repent” (as merely regret or apology)  
- **Clarification:** The word implies **transformation of thought and behavior**, not just emotional remorse.

## 5. διάβολος (*diabolos*)

- **True Meaning:** Slanderer, accuser  
- **False Translation:** Always “the devil” as a name  
- **Clarification:** While it refers to Satan in some contexts, it’s also a description of behavior—false accusation and division.

---

## 6. ἁμαρτία (*hamartia*)

- **True Meaning:** Missing the mark, deviation  
- **False Translation:** “Evil” or “depravity”  
- **Clarification:** *Hamartia* is about **missing the purpose or design**—it calls for correction, not condemnation.

---

## 7. πίστις (*pistis*)

- **True Meaning:** Faith, loyalty, trust in action  
- **False Translation:** “Belief” (as mere mental agreement)  
- **Clarification:** *Pistis* in scripture is **faithfulness**, often tied to covenant action, not passive belief.

## Final Word

These words have been twisted over centuries—some by design, others by neglect.  
In THE ASSEMBLY, we do not teach what we cannot trace.

To speak truth, we must know what was truly spoken.

— THE ASSEMBLY
