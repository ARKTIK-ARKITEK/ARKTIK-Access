**Return to the Language of the Covenant**

---

## “And these words, which I command you this day, shall be upon your heart.”  
— D'varim (Deuteronomy) 6:6

---

## Welcome

Hebrew is not just an ancient language.  
It is the **foundation of sound** through which the Torah was first spoken, written, and preserved.

We do not study Hebrew to appear wise.  
We study Hebrew to return—**to the source, to the rhythm, to the covenant.**

## Rhythm of Study

Start small.  
Speak aloud.  
Write with intention.

**Example Path:**

1. Learn 5 letters (aleph to hey)  
2. Trace or copy each one by hand  
3. Listen to pronunciation (via `pronunciation-guides/` in main `language-study/`)  
4. Speak one blessing aloud using those letters  
5. Repeat the next day

## Tips for Returning Learners

- Do not rush  
- Do not worry about perfect pronunciation  
- Do not compare yourself to anyone—not even who you used to be

This is about **repair**, not performance.

## Suggested Starting Point

- Then move to `daily-phrases.md` to begin practicing language in real-time alignment

## Final Word

If you’re just now learning Hebrew as an adult,  
If you were never taught,  
If you feel embarrassed to start now—

**That’s exactly why this was written.**

You’re not behind.  
You’re returning.

Welcome back to the language of the covenant.
