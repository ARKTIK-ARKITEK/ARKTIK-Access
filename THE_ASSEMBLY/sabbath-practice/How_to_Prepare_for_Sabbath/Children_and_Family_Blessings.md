## The Power of the Spoken Blessing

In Scripture, blessings were not only hoped for—they were spoken aloud.  
Before Sabbath begins, take a moment to **bless your household** by name.

## Traditional Blessings

### For Sons  
> “May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.”  
(Hebrew: *יְשִׂימְךָ אֱלֹהִים כְּאֶפְרַיִם וּכְמְנַשֶּׁה*)

### For Daughters  
> “May God make you like Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Leah.”  
(Hebrew: *יְשִׂימֵךְ אֱלֹהִים כְּשָׂרָה רִבְקָה רָחֵל וְלֵאָה*)

### General Family Blessing  
> “May THE ONE bless you and protect you.  
May His face shine upon you and be gracious to you.  
May He lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace.”  
(From Numbers 6:24–26)

## How to Give a Sabbath Blessing

- Place your hands gently on your child or loved one’s shoulders or head (if appropriate).  
- Speak the blessing with calmness and intention.  
- Optionally, follow with a short personal prayer:  
  > “I bless you with peace, with wisdom, and with rest. May your soul be refreshed this Sabbath.”

## Optional Additions

- Light a candle together and recite a family declaration.
- Write down new blessings weekly and place them near each bed or at the table.
