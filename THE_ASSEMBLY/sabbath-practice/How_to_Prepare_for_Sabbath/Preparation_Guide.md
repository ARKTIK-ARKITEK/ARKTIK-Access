## Why Preparation Matters

Preparation is part of the **commandment itself**.  
Without preparation, the Sabbath feels rushed, incomplete, or even burdensome.  
With preparation, it becomes a **delight** and a **spiritual elevation**.

## Key Areas of Preparation

### 1. Physical Preparation
- **Clean your home**: Set a peaceful, sacred atmosphere.  
- **Bathe or shower**: Washing before Sabbath is a sign of reverence.  
- **Lay out garments**: Prepare simple, clean clothes—avoid rushing on the day.

### 2. Household Preparation
- **Prepare meals** in advance: Focus on warm, nourishing food that requires little to no work.  
- **Light candles or lamps** before sunset.  
- **Set boundaries**: Turn off unnecessary electronics, silence distractions, and focus inward.

### 3. Spiritual Preparation
- **Forgive others** and settle disputes—enter the Sabbath with peace.  
- **Read scripture** or a Psalm that aligns your heart.  
- **Bless your children or household** with words of encouragement and peace.

## When to Begin

Preparation should begin **on the sixth day**, as commanded:

> “And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in...”  
> — Exodus 16:5

The day before Sabbath is called **Erev Shabbat**, meaning “Sabbath Evening.”  
Use this time to transition **from creating to ceasing**, **from doing to being**.

## Sabbath Entry Declaration (Optional)

> “With the setting of the sun and the lighting of the lamps,  
> I welcome the Sabbath into this home, this body, and this life.  
> I cease from striving, and I choose rest.  
> I honor THE ONE who sanctified the seventh day.”
