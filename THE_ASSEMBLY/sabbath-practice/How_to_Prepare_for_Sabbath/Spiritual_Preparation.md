## The Heart Must Be Ready

Sabbath is not just a pause from labor.  
It is an invitation to **behold, listen, and align**.  
We must clear our hearts from conflict, confusion, and noise.

## Key Practices for Spiritual Preparation

### 1. Set Down All Striving
- [ ] Let go of unresolved projects  
- [ ] Acknowledge what was done—and release what wasn’t  
- [ ] Choose stillness over scrambling

### 2. Forgive and Be Forgiven
- [ ] Reflect: Is there anyone I need to forgive?  
- [ ] Quietly offer forgiveness or ask THE ONE to help  
- [ ] Release bitterness before entering Sabbath

### 3. Read Aloud or Meditate On:
- Psalm 92: “A Song for the Sabbath Day”  
- Isaiah 58:13–14  
- Genesis 2:1–3  
- Any verse that centers your soul

### 4. Prayer Before Entry

> “THE ONE who sanctified the seventh day,  
> Sanctify my heart as I enter this sacred time.  
> Cleanse me of burden, fill me with peace.  
> Let me not carry what You’ve asked me to lay down.”

## A Gentle Reminder

You are not earning Sabbath.  
You are **returning** to the rhythm of creation.
