## Why Boundaries Are Sacred

The Sabbath is **holy time**, not just free time.  
Just as we fence a garden to protect it, we place **boundaries around Sabbath** to preserve its sanctity and peace.

## Key Sabbath Boundaries

### 1. No Buying or Selling
- Sabbath is not for commerce or transactions  
- Honor provision, don’t chase more

### 2. No Work or Producing
- Don’t finish work “just quickly”  
- Plan ahead so there’s no need to compromise

### 3. No Harsh Conversations
- Table hard discussions for another time  
- Avoid criticism, conflict, and debate

### 4. No Screen Overload
- Turn off or minimize phones, news, and entertainment  
- Use light and sound intentionally—set the tone

## Setting Expectations with Others

- Let guests know what Sabbath means to you  
- Kindly explain boundaries in advance  
- Honor guests by creating peace, not perfection

---

## Family and Community Boundaries

- Set a time for Sabbath to begin and end  
- Keep one room clear as a peaceful zone  
- Avoid inviting stress or chaos into the space

---

## Sabbath is Protected Time

Without boundaries, Sabbath becomes just another day.  
With boundaries, it becomes a **sanctuary in time**.
