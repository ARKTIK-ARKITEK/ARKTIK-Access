## Why Fellowship Matters

Sabbath is not always solitary.  
Sharing a meal or sacred time with others—when done in reverence—can **multiply joy** and **extend peace**.

---

## Guidelines for Fellowship

- Invite those who respect the boundaries of the day  
- Set the tone in advance: “This is a sacred time”  
- Focus on encouragement, joy, and presence—not correction

---

## Table Etiquette for Sabbath

- Begin with **blessings**:  
  - Over bread (*HaMotzi*)  
  - Over wine or juice (*Borei Pri HaGafen*)  
- Offer a moment of gratitude or scripture reading  
- Allow everyone present to speak one word of thanks or peace

---

## Sample Table Blessings

> “Blessed are You, THE ONE, who has brought us to this moment.”  
> “May this table reflect the peace of Eden.”  
> “We eat not in haste, but in holiness.”  
> “Let joy dwell here and burdens be lifted.”

## When Guests Join

- Provide a short, printed card or spoken invitation explaining what Sabbath means  
- Lead by example—gentle boundaries, sacred joy  
- Remember: Fellowship should **never dilute the sanctity** of the Sabbath

## The Sabbath Table Is a Testimony

Your home becomes a witness—  
A place where **THE ONE is honored**, and peace is practiced.
