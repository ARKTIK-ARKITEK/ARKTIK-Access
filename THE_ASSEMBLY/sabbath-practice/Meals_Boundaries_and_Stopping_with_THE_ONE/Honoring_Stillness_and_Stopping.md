## Stillness Is Not Emptiness

In a world addicted to movement, **stillness feels rebellious**.  
But Sabbath isn’t about filling time—it’s about **sanctifying it**.

Stopping is not failure—it’s alignment.  
Stillness is not absence—it’s presence.

## Biblical Reflections

### Genesis 2:2  
> “And He rested on the seventh day from all His work…”

### Psalm 131:2  
> “Surely I have calmed and quieted my soul…”

### Zechariah 2:13  
> “Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD…”

## How to Honor Stillness

- Resist the urge to fill every moment  
- Sit in silence without explanation  
- Let pauses during conversations remain sacred  
- Rest your hands, mind, and emotions  
- Welcome the discomfort—it often reveals what’s been buried

## Stopping Is an Offering

Stopping says:
> “I trust You, THE ONE.  
> I don’t have to earn today.  
> I don’t have to chase, prove, or perform.  
> I just need to **be**.”

## Suggested Practice

- Set a timer for 10 minutes of stillness before or after a Sabbath meal  
- Use breath as prayer: Inhale “You are here.” Exhale “And I am safe.”  
- Let stillness become your sanctuary
