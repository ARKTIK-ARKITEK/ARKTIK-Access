## Hosting Is Sacred Work

To host a Sabbath gathering is to open your home as a **mini-sanctuary**.  
It is not about perfection—it’s about presence, peace, and purpose.

---

## How to Prepare

### 1. Set the Atmosphere
- Clean and simplify the space  
- Use candles, lamps, or soft lighting  
- Choose music or silence intentionally

### 2. Prepare Guests
- Let them know Sabbath is a **sacred time**  
- Share what to expect (no phones, no rush, no stress)  
- Encourage reverence without rigidity

---

## The Flow of the Gathering

1. **Welcome + Lighting (before sunset)**  
2. **Blessings over bread and drink**  
3. **Shared meal and gentle conversation**  
4. **Optional scripture or reflective words**  
5. **Close with gratitude or a Psalm**

## Hosting with Balance

- Don’t over-plan—leave room for silence and joy  
- Invite participation, but lead with quiet strength  
- Prioritize peace over performance

---

## Sample Welcome Words

> “You are welcome in this space of rest.  
> This table is not just for eating, but for remembering.  
> May this time bring peace to your soul and glory to THE ONE.”

## When Hosting Becomes Ministry

Opening your space can be an act of **intercession and restoration**.  
But only if your home remains in alignment with Sabbath holiness.
