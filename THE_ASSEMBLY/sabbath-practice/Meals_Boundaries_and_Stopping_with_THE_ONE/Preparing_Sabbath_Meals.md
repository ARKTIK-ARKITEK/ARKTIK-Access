## Why Meals Matter

Sabbath meals are not ordinary.  
They are sacred **gatherings of gratitude**, not just meals of convenience.

Preparing meals in advance honors the command to rest and makes space for deeper presence with THE ONE.

## Planning with Purpose

### 1. Simple and Satisfying
- Choose dishes that are nourishing but not burdensome.
- Example: soups, stews, baked dishes, salads, roasted vegetables.

### 2. Prepare in Advance
- Cook on Friday (the sixth day)  
- Keep warm using minimal heat or serve cold dishes intentionally  
- Use food storage and portion planning to prevent excess labor

### 3. Table Setup
- Use a tablecloth or cover to elevate the space  
- Set out bread (challah or similar), juice or wine, and water  
- Light candles or lamps before sunset

## The Meal as a Sacred Act

- Begin with **blessings** over bread (*HaMotzi*) and drink (*Borei Pri HaGafen*)  
- Allow a moment of stillness before eating  
- Sing or speak Psalms, even just one verse

## Alkaline or Clean Living Tips

- Choose foods that align with your body's healing and energy needs  
- Avoid processed items when possible  
- Let the meal reflect **intentional living** and **holy joy**

## Spoken Intention (Optional)

> “This table is a reminder of Eden.  
> May every bite remind us that we are sustained by THE ONE.  
> May this meal bring peace, strength, and rest.”
