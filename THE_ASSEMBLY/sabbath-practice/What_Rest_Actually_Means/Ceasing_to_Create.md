## What It Means to Cease

Sabbath teaches us to stop producing—not because creation is bad,  
but because **we are not the Creator**.

To “cease to create” means:
- Letting go of work, production, and progress
- Trusting that THE ONE provides even when we stop
- Acknowledging that time, not just space, can be made holy

## Scriptural Reflection

### Genesis 2:2  
> “On the seventh day God **ceased** from all the work that He had done.”

### Exodus 34:21  
> “Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest—even during plowing and harvest.”

## What We Cease From

- [ ] Work  
- [ ] Worry  
- [ ] Control  
- [ ] Self-promotion  
- [ ] Fixing everything

Ceasing is **an act of humility and faith**.

## Spiritual Ceasing

- Stop “creating your own answers”  
- Stop striving for visibility or validation

## Spoken Reflection (Optional)

> “Today, I am not the builder.  
> Today, I am not the solution.  
> I cease from creating and rest in the Creator.”
