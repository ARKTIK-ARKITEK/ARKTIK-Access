## What Does “Shabbat” Mean?

The Hebrew word **שָׁבַת (Shavat)** literally means:  
- To cease  
- To stop  
- To rest from creating  
- To return to stillness

It is not merely stopping activity; it is **a divine cessation** with the purpose of **remembering, aligning, and delighting in THE ONE**.

## Scriptural Basis

### Genesis 2:2–3  
> “And on the seventh day God finished His work that He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.  
> And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it…”

### Exodus 20:8–11 (Ten Commandments)  
> “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy...  
> The seventh day is a Sabbath unto the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work…”

### Exodus 31:16–17  
> “It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever…”
