## Clarifying the Truth About Sabbath Rest

Many avoid or dismiss Sabbath because of **misunderstandings**.  
Let us correct these with clarity and reverence.

---

## Misconception 1: “Rest means laziness.”

**Truth:**  
Sabbath rest is not laziness—it is **discipline**.  
It takes faith to stop working when there is more to do.

---

## Misconception 2: “Rest is for the weak.”

**Truth:**  
Even THE CREATOR rested.  
Rest is a sign of strength, humility, and alignment—not weakness.

---

## Misconception 3: “It’s legalistic or outdated.”

**Truth:**  
The Sabbath was sanctified **before Sinai** (Genesis 2:3).  
It is a rhythm of **creation itself**, not just a law.  
Yeshua (Jesus) called Himself “Master of the Sabbath” because it was never revoked.

---

## Misconception 4: “Sabbath is only for Jews.”

**Truth:**  
The Sabbath was given to **mankind** at creation.  
It was reaffirmed for Israel as covenant—but open to all who align with THE ONE.

---

## Misconception 5: “It’s just about not working.”

**Truth:**  
It’s about **delighting in THE ONE**, pausing to reflect, restoring the soul, and sanctifying time.

## Final Reminder

> “If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath... and call the Sabbath a delight...  
> then you shall take delight in THE LORD.” — Isaiah 58:13–14

Sabbath is a **gift** to be received, not a burden to avoid.
