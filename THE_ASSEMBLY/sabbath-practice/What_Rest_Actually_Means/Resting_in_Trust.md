## What Is Trustful Rest?

Resting in trust means that you:
- Believe GOD is still in control while you stop
- Accept that your worth is not measured by output
- Lay down worry because THE ONE watches over you

---

## Trust Over Fear

- Fear says: “If I stop, everything will fall apart.”  
- Faith says: “When I stop, I give space for THE ONE to sustain.”

## Scriptural Anchors

### Psalm 127:2  
> “It is in vain that you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat—  
> for He gives sleep to His beloved.”

### Exodus 16:29  
> “See! THE LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day He gives you bread for two days.”

## Questions to Ask

- What am I afraid will happen if I truly rest?
- What control do I need to release back to THE ONE?
- Can I receive rest as a gift—not as something to earn?

## Sabbath Trust Declarations

> “I rest because I am loved.”  
> “I rest because I am not in control.”  
> “I rest because THE ONE is faithful.”  
> “I rest because I was not made to carry it all.”

---

## Remember:

Sabbath rest is a **declaration of faith** in the unseen provision of THE ONE.
