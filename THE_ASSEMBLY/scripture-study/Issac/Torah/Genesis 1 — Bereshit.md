## Chapter Summary

Genesis 1 describes the beginning of all creation. GOD speaks the universe into existence in six distinct phases, introducing time, space, matter, light, life, and order. The chapter concludes with the creation of mankind in GOD’s image and the establishment of Sabbath through rest.

### Day-by-Day Breakdown:

- **Day 1:** Light is created; separation of light from darkness.
- **Day 2:** Division between waters; creation of the sky (firmament).
- **Day 3:** Gathering of waters into seas; appearance of dry land; creation of vegetation.
- **Day 4:** Creation of sun, moon, and stars to govern day and night.
- **Day 5:** Creation of sea creatures and birds.
- **Day 6:** Creation of land animals and mankind (male and female) in the image of GOD. Dominion given to humanity.
- **Day 7 (Introduced in Genesis 2:1-3):** GOD rests, establishing the concept of Sabbath.

## Reflection & Notes

- What does it mean to be created in GOD’s image (*Tzelem Elohim*)?
- Why was each stage of creation called "good"—and what does that imply about order and purpose?
- Consider the structure: light before sun, division before form, rest after fullness. How does this mirror divine intentionality?
