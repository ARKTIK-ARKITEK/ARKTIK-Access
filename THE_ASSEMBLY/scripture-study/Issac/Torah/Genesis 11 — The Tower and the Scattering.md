## Chapter Summary

Genesis 11 recounts the rebellion at the Tower of Babel and the resulting scattering of humanity. It also continues the genealogy of Shem, leading to the birth of Abram (later Abraham), setting the stage for the covenantal narrative.

### Key Themes & Events:

- **One Language, One People:** Humanity initially speaks one language and settles in the land of Shinar.
- **Tower of Babel:** Men attempt to build a city and a tower to make a name for themselves.
- **Divine Intervention:** GOD confuses their language, causing them to stop building and scatter.
- **Origin of Nations:** The name “Babel” is linked to the confusion of language.
- **Lineage of Shem:** Traces Shem’s descendants through Arphaxad, Eber, and ultimately to Abram.
- **Introduction of Sarai and Terah’s Household:** Terah, father of Abram, leaves Ur of the Chaldeans, heading toward Canaan but settling in Haran.

## Clarification & Insight

- The sin of Babel was not technology or construction—but pride and the pursuit of a self-made legacy (*"Let us make a name for ourselves"*).
- The scattering was not a punishment of annihilation but a correction of direction—enforcing GOD’s earlier command to "fill the earth."
- The lineage continues through Shem, not interrupted by the rebellion at Babel.

---

## Reflection & Notes

- How does language both unite and divide humanity?
- What does the desire to “make a name” reveal about the condition of man post-flood?
- Why is Babel positioned before the introduction of Abram?
- What patterns of pride and redirection can be recognized today?
