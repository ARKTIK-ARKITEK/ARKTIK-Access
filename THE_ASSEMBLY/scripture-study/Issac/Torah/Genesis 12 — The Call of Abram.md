## Clarification & Insight

- **“Lech Lecha”** is not only a command but an invitation to discover identity and destiny.
- **Abram’s faith** begins with obedience, not full understanding. This is the model for covenantal trust.
- **Sarai’s identity** is concealed not for deception but for protection—showing the fragile balance between faith and strategy.
- **The blessing of nations** is rooted in alignment with GOD’s chosen servant.

## Reflection & Notes

- How does Abram’s departure from his homeland mirror spiritual migration?
- What can we learn from the tension between promise (Canaan) and problem (famine)?
- Why does GOD use affliction in Egypt to protect Sarai?
