## Clarification & Insight

- **Abram’s humility** is evident in allowing Lot the first choice, despite being the elder and the one holding the promise.
- **Lot’s decision** was based on sight, not discernment—foreshadowing future danger.
- **Sodom’s wickedness** is not incidental; it sets the stage for later judgment.
- **GOD’s reaffirmation** comes only after separation—reminding us that obedience and alignment bring fresh clarity.

## Reflection & Notes

- What does Abram’s approach to conflict resolution teach us about leadership?
- Why does GOD wait to restate the promise until Lot has departed?
- How can external beauty mask internal danger (as with Sodom)?
- What is the role of altars in spiritual journeying and covenant renewal?
