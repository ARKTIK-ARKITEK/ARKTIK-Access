## Clarification & Insight

- **Abram’s military leadership** is strategic, decisive, and rooted in righteousness—not conquest.
- **Melchizedek’s role** introduces the priesthood of El Elyon (Most High GOD) before Sinai and Levitical priesthood.
- **Abram’s tithe** is voluntary, given to one who honors GOD, not institutionalized.
- **Abram’s refusal** to accept the king of Sodom’s wealth reinforces his integrity and separation from wicked alliances.

## Reflection & Notes

- What does this teach us about defending family and community without seeking personal gain?
- Why is Melchizedek both king and priest? How does that shape future messianic expectations?
- What does Abram’s tithe reveal about his heart posture and recognition of divine victory?
- Why is it important that Abram refused to be made wealthy by the king of Sodom?
