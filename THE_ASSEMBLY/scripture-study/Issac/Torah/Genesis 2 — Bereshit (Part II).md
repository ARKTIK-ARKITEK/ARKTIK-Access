## Reflection & Notes

- What is the deeper meaning of rest (*Shavat*) as the first sacred gift to mankind?
- Why is obedience introduced before companionship?
- What does *Tzela* (side/rib) teach us about equality and distinction in divine partnership?
- How does the charge to work and guard (*L'ovdah u'leshomrah*) inform our role as stewards?
