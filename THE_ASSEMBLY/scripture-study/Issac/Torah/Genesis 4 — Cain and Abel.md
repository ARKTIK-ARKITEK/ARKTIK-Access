## Chapter Summary

Genesis 4 records the aftermath of Eden through the story of Adam and Eve’s sons—Cain and Abel. It marks the first murder in human history, the rise of cities, and the beginning of generational consequences.

### Key Themes & Events:

- **Birth of Cain and Abel:** Eve gives birth to two sons—Cain (the worker of the ground) and Abel (the keeper of sheep).
- **Offerings to GOD:** Both bring offerings; GOD accepts Abel’s but not Cain’s.
- **Cain’s Anger and Warning:** GOD warns Cain about sin crouching at the door, but Cain does not heed.
- **Murder of Abel:** Cain kills Abel in the field.
- **Divine Judgment:** GOD confronts Cain and places a curse upon him—he is banished to wander, but marked for protection.
- **Line of Cain:** Cain builds a city and fathers descendants who shape culture—musicians, metalworkers, herdsmen.
- **Lamech’s Violence:** Lamech boasts of killing a man and invokes an intensified vengeance.
- **Birth of Seth:** Adam and Eve bear Seth, from whom a new line of worshippers emerges.
