## Chapter Summary

Genesis 5 traces the genealogical line from Adam to Noah, establishing continuity through ten generations. This chapter introduces life spans, legacy, and the repetition of divine image-bearing in mankind. It also reveals a remarkable exception—Enoch, who “walked with God.”

### Key Themes & Events:

- **Book of the Generations:** Begins with the record of Adam’s lineage, affirming mankind’s creation in the image of God.
- **Repetitive Pattern:** Each generational entry includes the man’s age at the birth of his son, additional years lived, and his death—until Enoch.
- **Enoch’s Exception:** Rather than dying, Enoch “walked with God” and was taken.
- **Birth of Noah:** Lamech names his son Noah, prophesying relief from toil upon the cursed ground.
