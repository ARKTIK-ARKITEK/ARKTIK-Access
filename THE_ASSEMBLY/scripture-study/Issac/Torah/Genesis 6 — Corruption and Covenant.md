## Reflection & Notes

- What does it mean for GOD to "regret" creating man? Is it sorrow or legal judgment?
- Why is Noah’s righteousness so significant in contrast to his generation?
- What is the deeper symbolism of the ark (*Tevah*)—a vessel for preservation?
- How does the concept of *Brit* (covenant) shape redemption going forward?
