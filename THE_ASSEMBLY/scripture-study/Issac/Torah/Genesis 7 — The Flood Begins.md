## Reflection & Notes

- Why does GOD make a distinction between clean and unclean animals before the Torah is given?
- What does the repetition of divine instruction reveal about obedience and preparedness?
- How does the number forty reflect transformation or judgment in scripture?
- What can we learn about the concept of protection and separation within the ark?
