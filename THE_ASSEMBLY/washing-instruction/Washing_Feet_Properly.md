## Purpose

The washing of feet is a practice of **humility, sanctification, and preparation**.  
In ancient times, it marked respect for sacred space. In spiritual discipline, it marks the intention to walk **blamelessly and honorably** before THE ONE.

## Scriptural Basis

### Exodus 30:19–21  
> “They shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they do not die…”

### Genesis 18:4  
> “Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.”

### Isaiah 52:7  
> “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news…”

## When to Wash

- Before entering sacred spaces  
- Before prayer on holy days  
- Prior to Sabbath rest  
- As part of reconciliation or service

## How to Wash

1. Sit with clean water in a basin or bowl  
2. Gently pour water over the **right foot**, then the **left**  
3. Use a clean cloth to dry each foot  
4. If assisting someone else, approach with reverence and permission  
5. Speak peace or blessing silently or aloud

## Optional Spoken Intention

> “May these feet walk in truth.  
> May every place I step be sanctified.  
> I wash away weariness, and I return to stillness.”

## Notes

- Can be done alone, with a spouse, or in sacred community  
- Represents both cleansing and elevation  
- Water should be poured—not simply soaked
