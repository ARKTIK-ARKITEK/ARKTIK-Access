## Purpose

Washing hands is not only a matter of hygiene—it is a command rooted in Scripture and meant to instill **reverence, humility, and spiritual readiness**.

---

## Scriptural Basis

### Exodus 30:19–21  
> “Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet… so that they do not die.  
> It shall be a statute forever to them…”

### Psalm 26:6  
> “I wash my hands in innocence and go about Your altar, O LORD.”

## When to Wash

- Before prayer, meals, study, or sacred service  
- Upon waking  
- Before entering Sabbath  
- After using the restroom or handling impure items

---

## How to Wash

1. **Fill a vessel** with clean water  
2. Pour water **over the right hand** first, then the left  
3. Repeat **alternating 3 times** over each hand (total of 6 pours)  
4. Do not speak between washing and blessing  
5. Dry hands with a clean towel

## Optional Verbal Intention

> “As I cleanse my hands, may my heart also be clean.  
> Let these hands bring peace, never harm.  
> Let them build, not break. Let them serve, not strive.”

---

## Additional Notes

- Some traditions use a **two-handled cup (natla)**  
- Water should be poured from a **vessel**, not running directly from a tap when possible  
- Blessing is recited immediately after washing while hands are still wet
