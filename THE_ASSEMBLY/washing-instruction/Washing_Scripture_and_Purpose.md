## Scriptural Foundations

### Exodus 30:17–21  
> “Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying:  
> ‘You shall also make a basin of bronze, with its base of bronze, for washing.  
> You shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it.  
> Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet from it.  
> When they go into the Tent of Meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister...  
> they shall wash with water, so that they do not die.  
> It shall be a statute forever to them.’”

### Leviticus 16:4  
> “He shall bathe his body in water and then put them on.”

### Psalm 24:3–4  
> “Who may ascend the mountain of the LORD?  
> Who may stand in His holy place?  
> He who has clean hands and a pure heart…”

## The Purpose of Ritual Washing

1. **Sanctification**  
   - Cleansing before approaching sacred space or sacred duties.

2. **Separation**  
   - Washing marked a distinction between **holy and common**, **clean and unclean**.

3. **Readiness**  
   - One does not rush into the presence of THE ONE unprepared.

4. **Reverence**  
   - Washing creates physical and spiritual **intentionality**.

## Application in Daily Life

- Before prayer, study, and Sabbath  
- Upon entering or exiting the home  
- During moments of teshuvah (return/repentance)  
- As a daily reminder that **cleanliness begins in the soul**

## Final Thought

Water is not just for cleansing the body—  
It is for **realigning the spirit** to walk upright before THE ONE.
