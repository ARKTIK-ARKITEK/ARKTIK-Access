# Washing Instruction  
**Hands and Feet Before Prayer or Sacred Work**

---

## “So they shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they do not die; and it shall be a statute forever to them...”  
— Shemot (Exodus) 30:21

---

## WHY WE WASH

Before devotion. Before study. Before sacred acts.  
We return to the pattern given to Moshe.

We wash not to impress or perform,  
but to prepare—clean hands, clean steps, clean purpose.

In a world that rushes past reverence,  
we stop.  
We cleanse.  
We remember.

## WHAT YOU’LL NEED

- Clean water  
- Fresh lemon (if available)  
- A small basin, cup, or pitcher  
- A clean towel

> If lemon is available, squeeze a small amount into the water.  
> This naturally alkalinizes it, killing surface microbes, calming the spirit, and aligning the body with clean intention.

## REMEMBER THIS

This is not a ritual to perform.  
It is a rhythm to return to.

It is how we remind the body that something holy is happening.  
It is how we mark the moment—clean in spirit, clean in hands.

If it feels unfamiliar, that’s okay.  
You’re not late. You’re home.
